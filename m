Trying to come up with a signature for this bogus stuff is both time
consuming and having a risk of false positives.  And I really question
whether this thing is worth it.

The sane thing to do in this case is to declare the box inoperative
and that it needs to be fixed to avoid this behavior.

Any reasonable congestion control scheme is going to run into problems
trying to react to the packet patterns this thing creates.  It is
therefore not really limited to FRTO so it really shouldn't be treated
like an FRTO problem even though it shows up more pronounced when
=46RTO is enabled.
