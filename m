	OK, then let's just keep the !cp check and
later if cp is NULL just to NF_ACCEPT packets with
iph.fragoffs != 0, the check should be before calling
conn_schedule.

	In the case after calling ip_vs_lookup_real_service
is it correct to reject non-first fragment with
ICMPV6_PORT_UNREACH, is that allowed? May be we should
avoid sending ICMP errors to non-first fragment, what
is the right thing to do?

	I worry that cp can be expired by force at that
time, so lets add the above check before scheduling.

	You mean, only the first fragment has correct
mark, the following fragments can not be marked correctly
because we can not match the ports. And CONNMARK can not help
us because it depends on conntrack support?

	skb_dst_copy before PREROUTING is wrong even if
we do it for IPVS traffic, ip6_rcv_finish is going to
call dst_input. And all transmitters check the skb dst
to decide how to route the packet, so we have to leave
this job to transmitters, even for the fragments.

	Yes, it seems it will be needed to copy mark,
so that all IPVS fragments are forced to have same mark.

	Yes, there must be checks for fragoffs at some
places. May be it is a good idea to rename ip_vs_skb_hdr_ptr
to ip_vs_first_skb_hdr_ptr and to use it only at places
that need data from first fragment. Places that work
with current fragment will continue to use skb_header_pointer.
By this way we will know correctly which skb is accessed.
May be that is what you do but at least lets have a proper
func name.

	ok
