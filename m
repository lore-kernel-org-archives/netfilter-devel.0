Yes, which is why e.g. conntrack hash is not converted.

Yes.  None of these locations are executed via initcalls, they are all
in _checkentry (i.e., run when userspace iptables inserts a rule using
the target/match), except hashlimit where its delayed until the first
address is stored (so its even later).

Can you elaborate?  If entropy estimate is really really low
(because we're booting up), why would get_random_bytes() be a better
choice [ i understand net_get_random_once() is for delaying
the actual random_bytes call until a later point in time where we've
hopefully collected more entropy ]

It happens very very early on my machine, even before / is remounted
rw.  I would be more interested in what happens on small embedded
boxes...

I specifically did not use net_get_random_once once because checkentry is
not a hotpath.

I don't see why get_random_bytes use increases the security margin, especially
considering none of these hashes have periodic run-time rehashing?

But sure, if you think this change is a problem, Pablo can just revert it.
