Could you clarify what 'which don't leak ingress packets' means?

Yes, but see below.

I think there are several issues.

implementation problems:
- i'm not sure its legal to call the hook input with skb->sk locked,
  some matches might want to aquire it.
- what makes NFT_META_CGROUP special? (or was that just an example?)

design issues:
The assumption seems to be that a given skb can always be mapped to a
particular socket, and hence a cgroup.

Thats not necessarily the case, e.g. with broad-/multicasting or when
the socket is e.g. in timewait state.

Some skbs will now travel INPUT hooks twice.

And once you'd extend this so that we re-invoke nf hooks for mcast
packets, for each socket they've been received on, you change netfilter
behaviour again (one skb, one traversal -> n traversals of ruleset, one
for each sk).

I think that this makes it a non-starter, sorry.

I would much rather see nft_demux_{udp,tcp,sctp,dccp,...}.c which moves
early-demux-esque code into the nft ruleset.

Then you could do something like

nft add rule ip filter input meta l4proto tcp demux meta cgroup 42

The caveat being that even in this case we cannot guarantee
that skb->sk is set afterwards, or that a cgroup can be derived from it.

Iff you absolutely need this, I'd seriously entertain the idea of adding
NFPROTO_L4_TCP, etc, ... or, maybe better, allow to attach nft ruleset
as a socket filter.

But really, at that point, a much better question would be wheter net
cgroups are the answer to whatever the question was, or what problem we
are attempting to address here...
