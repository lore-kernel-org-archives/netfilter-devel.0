This is only true if one attribute is added. What I really meant
is something like em_text_dump() in em_text.c. Assuming we rework
areas like this one in order to avoid structs on the stack, we'll
have a lot of such cases where we might hit the limit while not
really knowing about the start of the nested tlv.

Anyways, I think this is a minor issue and we can safely ignore it
and delegate the trimming responsibility to the underlying layer
which "started" the nested tlv.

The gnet_stats interface was a bad example since it doesn't have
such a case.
