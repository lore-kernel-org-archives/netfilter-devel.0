I'm quite new to the internal of netfiler, especially about this part.
I will take a look at the code later.

This depends on the user land configuration of encapsulation order.
It can be one of the three types only(ah, esp, ipcomp), the most common=
ly
used is ah(outer)+esp(inner).

I barely see ipcomp used in production, but I remember RFC says ipcomp
should be done first before esp, because after encryption in esp, the d=
ata
is polluted, i.e., not suitable for compressed anymore(I'm not sure the
details theory behind this statement.)

Anyway, no matter how ah,esp,ipcomp are ordered, I think it only makes
sense for the outer header when using any one of those three filters, a=
nd
that's what I can imagine how it's been used.
