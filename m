Yes, but not multicast.

I know, and my primary attempt to get this fixed was to factor out the
early demux code from the socket matching code and make it available to
the cgroup matcher as well:


http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.firewalls.netfilter.devel/58054

That, however, got rejected because it doesn't work for multicast. This
patch set implements one of the things Pablo suggested in his reply.
