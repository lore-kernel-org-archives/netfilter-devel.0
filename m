The binary interface was broken in 1.4.11 with the guided option
parser:

commit 7299fa4b615d7f7ee12cde444266f6b31f667f9f

    libxt_CONNMARK: use guided option parser

You need a patch to use the new interface to stay in sync with current
iptables libraries. I'll make it for tc and send it to you.

BTW, I think it would be good if we find the way to check for
libxtables current version (see iptables/configure.ac), so you can
know that we broke binary compatibility again.

Cheers,
Pablo
