Hi David,

The following patchset contains four Netfilter updates, mostly targeting
to fix issues added with IPv6 NAT, and one little IPVS update for net-next:

* Remove unneeded conditional free of skb in nfnetlink_queue, from
  Wei Yongjun.

* One semantic path from coccinelle detected the use of list_del +
  INIT_LIST_HEAD, instead of list_del_init, again from Wei Yongjun.

* Fix out-of-bound memory access in the NAT address selection, from
  Florian Westphal. This was introduced with the IPv6 NAT patches.

* Two fixes for crashes that were introduced in the recently merged
  IPv6 NAT support, from myself.

You can pull these changes from:

git://1984.lsi.us.es/nf-next master

Thanks!
