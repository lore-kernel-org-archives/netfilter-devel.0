I really must read what I've written more carefully.   I should have 
gone on to say that I don't see that k(g)dboe will be viable in this use 
case although for someone actually debugging a kernel on a machine that 
they have access to xt_SYSRQ leaves an awful lot to be desired :-)   But 
that isn't the common use-case I see -- the one I see is where the sys 
admins used to have a "crash trolley" which was a console and PS/2 
keyboard which they could plug into a machine to get some information, 
but as many rack machines no longer have anything PS/2 and USB hot plug 
is unlikely to work on a sick machine we need a sufficiently light 
mechanism that it will work in most cases (xt_SYSRQ is careful to 
pre-allocate most of the resources it will need).


And then I should have said that moving on to the possibility of a 
standalone module and that ...

So unless I'm missing something obvious and different, I don't see that 
a standalone module is going to be lightweight enough to be acceptable.


Sorry for not making filling this parts in earlier.
