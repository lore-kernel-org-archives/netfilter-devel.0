Hi David,

The following patchset contains fixes for netfilter/ipvs. This round of
fixes is larger than usual at this stage, specifically because of the
nf_tables bridge reject fixes that I would like to see in 3.18. The
patches are:

1) Fix a null-pointer dereference that may occur when logging
   errors. This problem was introduced by 4a4739d56b0 ("ipvs: Pull
   out crosses_local_route_boundary logic") in v3.17-rc5.

2) Update hook mask in nft_reject_bridge so we can also filter out
   packets from there. This fixes 36d2af5 ("netfilter: nf_tables: allow
   to filter from prerouting and postrouting"), which needs this chunk
   to work.

3) Two patches to refactor common code to forge the IPv4 and IPv6
   reject packets from the bridge. These are required by the nf_tables
   reject bridge fix.

4) Fix nft_reject_bridge by avoiding the use of the IP stack to reject
   packets from the bridge. The idea is to forge the reject packets and
   inject them to the original port via br_deliver() which is now
   exported for that purpose.

5) Restrict nft_reject_bridge to bridge prerouting and input hooks.
   the original skbuff may cloned after prerouting when the bridge stack
   needs to flood it to several bridge ports, it is too late to reject
   the traffic.
