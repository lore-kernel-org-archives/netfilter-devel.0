Btw, I think it was Paul who pointed out that technically it's probably 
better to call them "local" and "global" lockers instead of "readers" and 
"writers".

That also probably clarifies the rules on when you use one over the other 
(ie reading off all the statistics is a "global" operation, as is 
obviously replacing the tables).

Of course, "readers" and "writers" is something most Linux lock people are 
more used to. Or "brlock" for the old-timers, but that involves a heavy 
dose of bad taste. The new use is much nicer, especially since it never 
takes the global lock on _all_ cpu's (which was really a killer in so 
many ways).
