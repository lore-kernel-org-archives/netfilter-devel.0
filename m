FRTO in 2.6.24.y is broken, I recently fixed couple of things in FRTO, 
late 2.6.25.y or 2.6.26 should be used to have all the fixes. If you can 
reproce with either one, please tcpdump it (I just returned, was couple of 
weeks away, so I'm slowly catching up what has happened in between here). 
...I guess somebody had dumped at least 2.6.24.y but that's not 
interesting due to known (and fixed) bugs with FRTO.
