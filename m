	LC and WLC are bursty by nature. May be a new
scheduler is needed that combines the LC algorithm with
WRR mode to adaptively reduce the difference in load,
especially for the case when new server is started in
a setup with many servers.

	Give me some days or week to analyze the effects of
your patch, mostly in situations of SYN attack. Note that
there can be schedulers affected by this change but I think
they will only benefit from it.
For example:

- LBLC, LBLCR: can use weight as threshold for activeconns
- NQ, SED: only activeconns are used
- OVF: weight is used as threshold for activeconns,
	inactconns are not used

	Schedulers not part of the kernel can be affacted
too. So, for now the plan is to apply this patch. If there
are other opinions, please speak up.
