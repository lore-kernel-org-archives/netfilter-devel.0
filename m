Sorry, couldnt resist - so out of hiding for just a few seconds; should
be able to achieve this much simpler with gact.

Example:
Consider two machines with allowed to receive only packets for 10.0.0.3.
A simple balance scheme is to have even src IPs being processed by one
and odd by another.

#add ingress qdisc to eth2
# Accept arps destined for 10.0.0.3 but sourced from even numbered
# src addresses
tc filter add dev eth2 parent ffff: protocol arp prio 6 u32 match u32
0xa000003 0xffffffff at 24 match u8 0x0 0x1 at 17 flowid 1:2 action ok
# drop any other arps for 10.0.0.3
tc filter add dev eth2 parent ffff: protocol arp prio 7 u32 match u32
0xa000003 0xffffffff at 24 flowid 1:2 action drop

On a second machine which is doing odd just change the u8 to 0x1 0x1.
No need to send fake ARPs using multicast with this. But if you wanted
to be funky you could use pedit to create a virtual MAC address.

We use this well with a lot more complex static rules and failover.

cheers,
jamal (Back to work)
