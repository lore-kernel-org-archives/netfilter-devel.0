I validated that it was only an API concern, by commenting out the code,
and got 20Gbps (link speed) using the sample program (using a bigger
buffer to receive the skbs and removing the printf() for each packet)

Pablo followed the experiments and I believe he has an idea of the
needed API. Anyway, after one week in NFWS, I wont have the time to do
it, I have a huge backlog...

Note that its not a zero copy :

Before the patch we had 2 copies. (kernel->kernel done in softirq
context, and kernel->user in process context)

After the patch we have the copy from kernel to user land, done
in process context.
