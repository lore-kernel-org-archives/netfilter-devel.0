	For IPVS skb_net is too complicated. One of
the first things we do in hook handler is to check
skb_dst, so even now dev_net(skb_dst(skb)->dev) should
work. sock_net is used for administration via netlink,
skb_net is not used there (ip_vs_ctl.c).

	As for removing/replacing skb_net, ip_vs_conn_net()
is ok when cp is present, we have also svc->net, otherwise
we can store net into struct ip_vs_iphdr, it is filled by
ip_vs_fill_iph_skb from small number of places when hook
handler is entered.
