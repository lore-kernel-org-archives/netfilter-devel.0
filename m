The value of len here is how many bytes were returned by recv. We do
send the entire nlmsg_len to userspace, but recv cannot copy the full
packet because the buffer is not big enough to hold this. They only
allocate the buffer assuming that the packet won't be bigger than their
snap len, but we send more data than their snap len and they don't
handle this condition well.
