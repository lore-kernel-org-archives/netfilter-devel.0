The main reason why I didn't add this is since it assumes you have a
single rule per destination. That assumption can't be made, so you'd
have to maintain a table of options per destination.

I'll add the synconf tool to generate rules based on what the server
actually supports to the iptables repository once this has been merged.

Yes, that could be done.
