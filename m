There is also another option of removing the procfs files altogether in
revision 2. The files were only used for debugging and any users relying
on the file being present will continue to see it as long as they are in
revision 1.

If we do need these files, we can create another option in rev2 which
explicitly enables procfs but leave them disabled by default. And we can
retain the existing behavior assuming whoever is using it knows its
caveats. Please suggest.
