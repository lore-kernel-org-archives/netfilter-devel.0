Hold it.
git would never output ~7172~1092~2 because ~8266 would be much simpler.

I originally wrote "Commit v2.6.28-rc1~717^2~109^2~2", but one of your 
programs seems to eat commit messages or more.

(BTW, are not inline patches preferred for reply? Attachments do not 
automatically get quoted and I have to export it, reimport it, and
have it filtered through perl to add a >.)
