Except that commit effectively moved that function from
net/netfilter/nf_tables_netdev.c to
include/net/netfilter/nf_tables_ipv4.h while commit c73c24849011
("netfilter: nf_tables_netdev: remove redundant ip_hdr assignment")
removed the assignment in the original file (and has been in your tree
since v4.8-rc7) and that is where I originally actually got a conflict.

no worries.
