My fist implementation used sysfs/debug.
I've switched to /proc/net/netfilter/ to make it consistent to the other
netfilter stuff...
Moving back to sysfs/debug/whatever can be done within minutes.

In which use-cache you need two _consuming_ readers?
Steve's ring_buffer supports also concurrent non-consuming reads.
I can add support for this...

I really don't like this rlogd thing.

1. It's yet another random netfilter userspace component.
Please don't fragment it more.
Installing iptables/conntrack/ulogd/etc... is already enough PITA 
because not all distros ship all this clustered components.

2. As I described in my very fist RLOG patch, NFLOG does not include the 
same information.
You cannot derive "PHYSIN" and "PHYSOUT" from the packet header.

3. rlogd needs NFLOG which copies every packet (header) to userspace.
What about performance...?
