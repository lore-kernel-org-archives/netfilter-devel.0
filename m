So this is a repost of the same thing.  These lockless iterators
won't be usable by netfilter as it stands because it wants to do
nested walks and also isn't currently lockless.

However, I'll wait for Patrick to post his pending patches to see
what exactly he needs before implementing helpers for that case.

Cheers,
