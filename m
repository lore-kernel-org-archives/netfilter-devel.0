I tried 2.6.25.10 without luck. I have a git "master" tree from yesterd=
ay=20
which is also stalling for some seconds around ~220kb and then recoveri=
ng.=20
The connection completly stalls at around ~1.3mb. I'll send you a tcpdu=
mp
in private soon as it's going to be rather big for the mailinglist.
