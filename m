Kconfig is too smart for its own good: a Kconfig line that states

	select NF_DEFRAG_IPV6 if IP6_NF_IPTABLES

means that if IP6_NF_IPTABLES is set to 'm', then NF_DEFRAG_IPV6 will
also be set to 'm', regardless of the state of the symbol from which
it is selected. When the xt_TEE driver is built-in and nothing else
forces NF_DEFRAG_IPV6 to be built-in, this causes a link-time error:

net/built-in.o: In function `tee_tg6':
net/netfilter/xt_TEE.c:46: undefined reference to `nf_dup_ipv6'

This works around that behavior by changing the dependency to
'if IP6_NF_IPTABLES != n', which is interpreted as boolean expression
rather than a tristate and causes the NF_DEFRAG_IPV6 symbol to
be built-in as well.

The bug only occurs once in thousands of 'randconfig' builds and
does not really impact real users. From inspecting the other
surrounding Kconfig symbols, I am guessing that NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_TPROXY
and NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_SOCKET have the same issue. If not, this
change should still be harmless.

I have done a few thousand randconfig builds with this applied, and the
problem did not come back, but it is super-rare.

Several people have tried to fix this in the past, but so far
every patch was wrong. Maybe this one is lucky.
