Currently not, the conntrack association is done at a later point.
We could add a classifier or TC action that performs the lookup
during ingress classification.

Alternatively classifiers using conntrack information (like cls_flow)
could perform the lookup directly, but that would probably get a bit
ugly since some validation needs to be performed previously and it
would add a module dependency on conntrack.
