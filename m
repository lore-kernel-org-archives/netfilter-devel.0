The normal rules of parentage apply.   So the child will see simply
see it's parent as ppid == 0.  If that child daemonizes it will become
a child of the pid namespaces init.

This is a lot like something that gets started from call_usermodehelper.  It's
parent process is not a descendant of init either.


The implementation of the join is to simply change current->nsproxy->pid_ns.
Then to use it you simply fork to get a child in the target pid namespace.

In a lot of ways I like this idea of sys_hijack/sys_cloneat, and I
don't think anything I am doing fundamentally undermines it.  The use
case of doing things in fork is that there is automatic inheritance of
everything.  All of the namespaces and all of the control groups, and
possibly also the parent process.  It does have the high cost that the
process we are copying from must be stopped because there are no locks
that let us take everything.  I haven't looked at the recent proposals
to see if anyone has solved that problem cleanly.



If we can do a sys_hijack/sys_cloneat style of join, that means we can
afford a fork.  At which point the my proposed pid namespace semantics
should be fine.

aka:
setns(NSTYPE_PID);
pid = fork();
if (pid == 0) {
	getpid() == 2; /* Or whatever the first free pid is joined pid namespace */
        getppid() == 0;
} else {
	pid == 6400; /* Or whatever the first free pid is in the original pid namespace */
	waitpid(pid);
}

That would probably work.  setsid() and setpgrp() have similar sorts
of restrictions.  That is both more challenging and more limiting than
the semantics that come out of my unshare(CLONE_NEWPID) patch.  So I
would prefer to keep this sort of thing as a last resort.

If all we do is populate an unused struct upid in struct pid there
isn't a chance of a problem.

Overall it sounds like the semantics I have proposed with
unshare(CLONE_NEWPID) are workable, and simple to implement.  The
extra fork is a bit surprising but it certainly does not
look like a show stopper for implementing a pid namespace join.
