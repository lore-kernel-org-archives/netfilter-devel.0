This follows a convention in include/uapi/linux/netfilter/*.h that
likely predates the introduction of uapi. A search for "Used
internally by the kernel" shows many more examples. I should not have
included filter.h, however. The common behavior when using pointers
to kernel-internal structures is to have a forward declaration. I suggest
making that change, instead of changing to void *. This avoids having
to add casts where xt_bpf_info is used in net/netfilter/xt_bpf.c:

-#include <linux/filter.h>
 #include <linux/types.h>

 #define XT_BPF_MAX_NUM_INSTR   64

+struct sk_filter;
+
 struct xt_bpf_info {

I can send this as a separate patch to net-next, if that helps.
