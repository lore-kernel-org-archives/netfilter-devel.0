Hi Jan.

I think this increased command line length hardly matters.

I think a reasonable complaint might be that it separates
the definition of a macro from the code.  I think it's
similar to the already used KBUILD_MODNAME macro though.

It's not just IPVS, this style could be used treewide
without requiring extra #includes.
