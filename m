True, but some of these cleanups are genuine.  Deleting code also
increases the coverage of the testsuite: I've put this in my patch set
and will merge them in pieces.  At the rate I work, those that are
needed in the next few months won't be deleted.  If patches are not due
to be merged in that timeframe, it'd be nice if they contained the
exports etc. that they need rather than relying on long-term unused
features of the tree.

Cheers,
Rusty.
