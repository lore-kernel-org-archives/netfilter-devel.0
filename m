While GFP_ATOMIC does indeed look the correct solution for this particular
case I was wondering whether something like (GFP_KERNEL & ~__GFP_WAIT)
wouldn't also make the cut without causing sleeping? I guess this is exactly
the sort of situation that Mel Gorman's patch can address
(marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=144283282101953) ?

In any case I will send v2 tomorrow.
