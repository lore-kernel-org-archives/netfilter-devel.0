First off, *please* CC netfilter-devel on patches relating to netfilter.
I've said this a hundred times in direction of the container guys
(not sure whether you specifically) and it keeps getting ignored.

Well, there's no other choice I guess.

The tables are shared between IPv4 and IPv6, this keeps track of the
number of current users to avoid unregistering it while the AF-specific
module for either one is loaded. This would still be a global counter
with containers I think since module loading is global and they should
be visible in all containers if IPv4 or IPv6 conntrack is loaded.

Please use an iteration to avoid these repetitve overly long lines.
