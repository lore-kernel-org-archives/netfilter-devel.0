Have you ever tested that? I am afraid no panic will happen.
nf_ct_kill_acct() just drops the reference owned by the corresponding
timeout timer to the ct if the timer is installed, so the skb still
has the reference to the ct after nf_ct_kill_acct() returns. Thanks.

BTW: all the patches related to netfilter should be sent to the
netfilter developer mailing list.
