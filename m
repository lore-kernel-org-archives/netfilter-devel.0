If it would lock out the resize for the entire dump I would not have
done patches 1 and 2 ;-)

I does provide better behaviour if the whole dump fits into a single
buffer or if it fits into 2 buffers and we are already dumping into
the 2nd buffer when the resize occurs. Otherwise we will see resizes
and thus tons of duplicates even in those scenarios even if no insert
or removal occurs in parallel.

In the case of Netlink diag that should be typical case. Most systems
will not have 1000s of Netlink sockets in parallel.

I don't like the flag as it prevents resizes (and possibly rehashes
further down the road) for a long period of time. The hashtable
becomes attackable.
