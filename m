Indeed it should!!!  It is out-of-line due to header-file issues.
Lai Jiangshan proposed a change to kbuild to allow it to be inlined as
part of his ring-RCU patch, and I have asked him to submit a version
of that for Tree and Tiny preemptible RCU.  This is the usual trick of
having the build system compile the data structure and emit offsets,
which are then used in the main kernel build.  (Yes, I did something
similar in DYNIX/ptx, but never managed to work up the courage to attempt
the equivalent in Linux's kbuild, so props to Lai!)

Here is what it looks like in my -rcu tree:

void __rcu_read_lock(void)
{
	current->rcu_read_lock_nesting++;
	barrier();  /* needed if we ever invoke rcu_read_lock in rcutree.c */
}

So yes, I finally did convince myself that the ACCESS_ONCE was not
needed.  ;-)

This is not yet in mainline, but Ingo sent the series containing this
commit (80dcf60e) to Linus earlier today, so there is hope!

							Thanx, Paul
