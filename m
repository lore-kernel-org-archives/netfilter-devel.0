It's not a garbage socket, but it could be a socket for a completely
different address family than ipv4/ipv6.  The canonical example is
AF_PACKET transmitting over an encapsulating device.

Tom if you are saying that skb->sk should be reset to the tunnel
socket, that doesn't work and is completely broken.

You must retain the original skb->sk of the application so that socket
memory accounting does not break.  You can't just rewrite skb->sk
during tunnel encapsulation.

That's the whole point these changes.

If an AF_PACKET socket transmits over a UDP encapsulating tunnel device
we want skb->sk to be the AF_PACKET socket for socket memory accounting
purposes, and pass down explicitly the UDP tunnel socket through the
output path starting at the point of UDP encapsulation.
