Please, again, this as nothing to do with personal firewall.
The same problem remain if I want to write the same tool related to
filesystem.
We should definitly stop using 'personal firewall' as a excuse.
We just want a simple way to enable another security model. And you
should known that we already have the "security=" boot param [1]

So now the good question is what are we going to do when using a
personal firewall based on LSM, for the others non-related network
syscalls ?

Providing dynamical support for next unknown protocols ?.. hum I'm
losing myself, and I hope to misunderstand you thought.

anyway, you can propose patches on snet to do that.

I already thought about a policy caching, even a 'verdict to rules'
caching. But you can implement the policy caching from the userspace.
And this won't work:

1. syscall A on protocol Y
2. look inside cache for verdict -> found nothing
3. ask userspace
4. kernel get a verdict, apply the verdict, put the verdict on cache.
5. same syscall and protocol as in 1
6. look inside cache -> apply cache verdict

what if the user changes it's rules between 4 and 5 ?
Yes, I known we won't change rules every seconds. we can clear the
cache. 
But this are implementation details, and we can easy move snet to have
this feature.

Also, how will you build a cache for a such informations ?
We surely want to cache the rule we match.

But anyway caching is regarding only some syscalls (as connect(),
recvmsg(), sendmsg())

And here we start speaking about how to build a personal firewall. And
this is exactly what I don't want. snet is here to let you have all the
freedom for this question. What if someone else don't want a policy
cache ? we put some param to enable or disable it ? No, the best way is
to let userspace do what he wants.
