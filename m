OK. As a nice side-effect, this will lead to removing the branch that
tests ESP/AH in hmark_set_tuple_ports.

Please, use the patch that I sent you yesterday. Recover the swap
behaviour that you need, I'll mangle the patch myself to add the
little comment to explain why we do this with CT as well.

BTW, note that you do *not* have to remove the XT_HMARK_SPI flags, we
still need those for iptables-save.

While at it:

+enum {                      
+       XT_HMARK_NONE,       
+       XT_HMARK_SADR_AND,   
+       XT_HMARK_DADR_AND,   
+       XT_HMARK_SPI_AND,    
+       XT_HMARK_SPI_OR,    

remove all trailing _OR

+       XT_HMARK_SPORT_AND,  
+       XT_HMARK_DPORT_AND,  
+       XT_HMARK_SPORT_OR,   
+       XT_HMARK_DPORT_OR,   
+       XT_HMARK_PROTO_AND,

rename all _AND by _MASK.

+       XT_HMARK_RND,        
+       XT_HMARK_MODULUS,    
+       XT_HMARK_OFFSET,     
+       XT_HMARK_CT,         
+       XT_HMARK_METHOD_L3,  
+       XT_HMARK_METHOD_L3_4,
};

What I'm asking should require very little changes in the kernel-code.

documentation is fine.

iptables can stop this by spotting a warning message from user-space.
