Their ugliness is because of the current API, which cleaned up
quite a lot of the surrounding code, but requires this ugliness
from each helper. I would like to keep them visible as a reminder
that a cleaner solution is wanted, but moving them to header
files certainly sound like a good idea to eliminate the risk
of prototype conflicts. But please do this for all helpers
at once.

I would prefer that too.
