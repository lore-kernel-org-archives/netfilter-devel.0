But that would still mean that a user sending a
NLM_F_REQUEST|NLM_F_REPLACE|NLM_F_EXCL message would be misinterpreted
as NLM_F_DUMP.
There just is no way for genl to figure out from an arbitrary nlmsghdr
whether it's a dump request or something else without breaking 
something.
The overlapping of NLM_F_ is quite unfortunate.
