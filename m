Sorry for interrupt, and thanks for review. I posted this patch to
check if I was in the right direction.

I think we can't change the structure of ipt_entry, as it is exposed
to userspace as an ABI. Though there is no need to keep the same
structure in the kernel space, converting is a big work. :)

This is what I worry about. I think only test can verify it.

Thanks. I'll try.
