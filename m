Why 32?

If you do up() once per message, you will still get an arbitrary
number of messages in the queue until the scheduler selects your
thread to enter the running state.

In other works, if you do up() once per 32 messages, your thread will
get N+32 messages in its queue by the time the scheduler makes it
enter the running state. Being N that amount of arbitrary messages.
This seems to me like more chances to overrun the socket buffer under
high stress.

Well, this is not exactly the idea I had in mind.

I don't see the up+kthread_stop() race you mention.

OK.

I still think that using an intermediate queue is *not* the way
to achieve reliability and congestion control, sorry.

But, you seem to persist on the idea and I don't want to block your
developments, I just wanted to show my point and provide some ideas.
After all, you maintain that part of the code.

Please, tell me what patch you want me to apply and I'll take it.
