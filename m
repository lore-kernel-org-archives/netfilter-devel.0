Well, I actually already suggested to David that he should just merge the 
last patch I saw floating around (with the "recursive" -> "readwrite" fix 
in the comment ;), so that we can at least get the basic issue fixed, and 
then we can tweak it a bit with smaller patches flying around.

And at least right now, the difference between the rwlock and the 
"count+spinlock" should be basically almost unnoticeable, and a very small 
implementation issue. They're entirely interchangeable, after all.

I don't have any strogn preferences, but I'd almost prefer to not abstract 
things out even that much. It's already pretty well hidden inside 
<netfilter/x_tables.h>, I'd hate to add a new file just for this. 

As to just adding more commenting that it must not be used anywhere else, 
I certainly agree with that.

local/remote works for me, and yes, since we only take the remote side one 
CPU at a time, I guess "global" is misleading. But "owner/foreigner" 
sounds pretty odd.

Yes. Other CPU's just require preemption protection.

Agreed.

Ack.
