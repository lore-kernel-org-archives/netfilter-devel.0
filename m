From: Michael Maxim <mike@okcupid.com>

Modify the algorithm to build the source hashing hash table to add
extra slots for destinations with higher weight. This has the effect
of allowing an IPVS SH user to give more connections to hosts that
have been configured to have a higher weight.

The reason for the Kconfig change is because the size of the hash table
becomes more relevant/important if you decide to use the weights in the
manner this patch lets you. It would be conceivable that someone might
need to increase the size of that table to accommodate their
configuration, so it will be handy to be able to do that through the
regular configuration system instead of editing the source.

+	  The source hashing scheduler maps source IPs to destinations
+	  stored in a hash table. This table is tiled by each destination
+	  until all slots in the table are filled. When using weights to
+	  allow destinations to receive more connections, the table is
+	  tiled an amount proportional to the weights specified. The table
+	  needs to be large enough to effectively fit all the destinations
+	  multiplied by their respective weights.
