Or use pcap_compile? I went with the tcpdump output to avoid
introducing a direct dependency on pcap to iptables. One possible
downside I see to pcap_compile vs. developing from scratch is that it
might lag in supporting the LSF ancillary data fields.

I'll add that. I'd like to keep --bytecode to able to generate the
code inline using backticks.
