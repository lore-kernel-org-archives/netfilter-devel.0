Hello,
This two patches are for the current kernel, i.e. based on ipvs.git

The first one is a trivial fix for lockdep warnings,
and the second is to solve a Deadlock.

We have observed one more Deadlock case in our lab during startup of multiple containers i.e. netns.
The back trace indicates some more issues with "sk_lock-AF_INET"
However it has only been seen once during almost 4 month of testing.
I can't reproduce it and not find any possibly scenario where it could occur.

This patch fix the case when a name-space dies while another is created.

Regards
Hans Schillstrom <hans.schillstrom@ericsson.com>
