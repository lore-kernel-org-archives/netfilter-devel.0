I like this version 8 of the patch, as it mixes all ideas we had,
but have two questions.

Previous netfilter code (and 2.6.30-rc2 one too) disable BH, not only p=
reemption.

I see xt_table_info_lock_all(void) does block BH, so this one is safe.

I let Patrick or other tell us if its safe to run ipt_do_table()
with preemption disabled but BH enabled, I really dont know.

Also, please dont call this a 'recursive lock', since it is not a gener=
al
recursive lock, as pointed by Linus and Paul.

Second question is about MAX_LOCK_DEPTH

Why dont use this kind of construct to get rid of this limit ?
