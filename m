IIRC during worm attacks all windows (according to OSF) traffic
was just routed via slow/shaped device (that was forwarding on
a gateway with appropriate NAT). Right now I would recomment to
use recent/rateest module to make fine-grained tuning of the connection.

I bet it is not the last one :)

Cool. If no none will reply, nothing actually changes :)
OSF lived on its own all the time except several months in patch-o-matic
and then its next generation.

It uses proc to load rules - I do not like it either, but it was the
