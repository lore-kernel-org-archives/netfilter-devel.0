I disagree. LOCAL_IN is for locally delivered packets, and both the
decrypted and the encrypted packet are delivered locally. This is
true for tunnel mode, handling transport mode the same way seem
consistent, not confusing to me. This is also the way klips has
done it for ages and users are used to this and are actually asking
for exactly this behaviour.

Well, this is not intended but one of the problems I want to fix.

Same holds here. LOCAL_OUT is for locally generated packets, and should
see both the plain text and the encrypted packet. This is entirely
consistent with other tunnels like IPIP or GRE.

We can't do that because introducing new hooks to the tables breaks
userspace compatibility.
