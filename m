Hmm.... 1-3 will be needed to address similar issues in a different
controller, so putting them in a separate branch would work best.  I
created a branch which contains the 1-3 on top of v4.4-rc1.

  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tj/cgroup.git for-4.5-ancestor-test

If creating a different branch from net side is better, please let me
know.

Right, it doesn't work well on INPUT side, so the big warning in the
man page.

I thought it would be confusing because the two are completely
separate.  Hmmm... okay, I'll merge it into xt_cgroup.

Thanks.
