Just a quick heads up.

In my work to pass struct net down into the netfilter functions so they
don't have to guess, I wound up performing some significant surgery on
ipvs.  In particular so the code stayed clean I wound up turning the
relationship between struct net, and the structures netns_ipvs,
ip_vs_conn_param, ip_vs_conn, ip_vs_service inside out.  That is in
every structure holds a struct net reference and in every function that
takes a struct net reference I use a struct netns_ipvs reference
instead.

In most cases netns_ipvs is what the code actually wants so this just
reduces the unncessary rigamarole the code has to go through, and just
plain feels cleaner.  For example all of the sysctl wrappers wind up
taking struct netns_ipvs reference because it has become the natural
thing for them to do.

There are also quite a few functions where I have added a netns_ipvs
parameter so they would not have to guess, so in the addition of
parameters the code change is about the same as my previous patch.

I do not think there are any conflicts that will be difficult to resolve
between this patchset and my pending changes, as my pending changes
barely perform any changes of substance.  My changes do result in
conflicts.

For example in my pending changes and in this patchset they both change
the function prototype of ip_vs_protocol.conn_in_get.  My pending
changes add struct netns_ipvs as the first parameter and these patches
remove the final inverse parameter.
