One (not very pretty) possibility would be to store the address/port
somewhere in the skb and use it for the socket lookup. I think thats
also what the 2.2 code did. Other than that I don't have any ideas
either, but I'm not too familiar with that code, maybe someone else
could explain whether caching the sockets would really be a problem
and why.

Makes sense.

Also sounds reasonable.
