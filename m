I am asking you to switch to the TC code. I dont think i am making my
point across ;->[1]. Integrate your classifer like any other tc
classifier and then you dont have to look at my code unless you really
want to.

These types are most dominant these days in my opinion unless you are a
single user behind a DSL line.

Isnt the state database another classifier and therefore you will be
faced with the same challenges for it?=20
I dont think you wuill get a free ride putting the state lookups
somewhere else.

tc allows you to have multiple cascaded classifiers; so=20
you could "reclassify" and jump to a state classifier.
I think the other guys from .dk also had their own scheme of achieving
the same goal. Being able to do this in my opinion is architecturally
cleaner.

This is true if you consider the state database to be a different
problem other than a classification one.=20

no problem.

>=20

You are in academia, you better make sure you are aware of these=20
things ;->=20

The Lakshman paper describes an algorithm but i remember it was the
first to introduce classification constraints:

T.V.Lakshman and D.Stiliadis. High Speed Policy-based Packet Forwarding
Using Efficient Multi-dimensional Range Matching. Proceedings of ACM
Sigcomm98

Another good paper to look at is:

A.Feldmann and S.Muthukrishnan. Tradeoffs for packet classification.
Proceedings of IEEE Infocom2000

Then you have some work to do

Couldnt you, knowing the rules already existing check for breakage in
user space?

I meant that network access verifier. I believe you should be able to
verify things not only just in user space bu even in a remote location
(example a network management station). Now this stuff is interesting.

cool. Looking forward to see some of your thoughts on this when you have
experienced it.

cheers,

[1] Look at your action code dispatch name and my old one and note the
name being _exactly_ the same. I dont think it is a big coincidence and
i dont think you had any bad intent. I am just saying you can continue
doing that or you can integrate. Why dont we drop this part of the
discussion if you dont wanna move forward to the tc code? I thought you
agreed with Dave to integrate ;->
