I have updated cn_net, for supporting libnl and having a library in
userspace.
http://www.synack.fr/project/snet/snet.html
but you are perfectly right, this is exactly what I implemented.

be carefull, you are mixing 2 distincts questions in fact :

1. how to have differents security models in the kernel, dealing with
   the LSM hooks ?

2. how to build a 'personnal firewall', based on syscall applications ?

I have a answer for the second question, it's snet, as it's the simplest
way for the kernel to deal with this problem.

For the first question, you can build a personnal firewall with LSM
hooks, if, at compilation time, you don't choose other LSM
solutions. that's how I'm using snet.
But what you are asking is to have multiple security models at the same
time, with some kind of priority.
I don't know if it's ok or not, but what I'm sure is that snet will use
LSM hooks or your new framework without any problems in fact, as you are
going to make some kind of wrapper on the members of the struct
security_operations.

Indeed I thought about that when writing snet.

I agree that can be issue, but this as nothing to do with implementing a
personnal firewall. you see, there are 2 questions beside your
thought.

You can ask yourself about having the same kind of subsystem for
syscalls related to filesystem (open, read, write, ..).
So you can build your own security model by picking-up a subsystem A
for networking part, and a subsystem X for the filesystem part.
in this way, you can let people writing differents models for networking,
or filesystem, and so on.

I won't fight for this idea, because I'm not sure it's right or not. I
just thought about when developping snet, because I wanted to plug the
same kind of code as snet, dealing with others security hooks (as
filesystem, ..), to complete the job of snet.
But I personnaly have no shame to said that, in the 'security' point of
view, I don't known if this model means something.

concerns about tuxguardian:
 - it is using sock_sendmsg/sock_recvmsg for userspace communication.
 - there is no timeout when waiting for userspace decision on the
   syscall
 - it is dealing only with members .socket_create and .socket_listen
   from the struct security_operations
