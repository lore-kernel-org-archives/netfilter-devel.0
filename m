>=20

It has historical reason. The original version which didn't use netlink=
=20
(at kernel 2.6.17) used zero to indicate that group was not set. You=20
wrote previously that this part is useless for new kernels. I'll fix=20
this (with type of "group" variable to unsigned int32 to be consistent=20
with the kernel part).
