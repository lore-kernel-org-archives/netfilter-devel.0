Running 'walker | grep foo | less' really shouldn't stop any activity,
including further requests by the same person to dump the same table in a
different window.
I would also expect the above request to be able to continue correctly
when restarted hours later (unless something unusual - like a resize -
happens).

Suppressing 'table shrink' because you think a walker might be active
if probably a good idea, and just requires a timestamp of the last
walk action.

Thought...
It is possible to break walking only on hash chain boundaries?
At least in the case where the response buffer is large enough
for a full 'chain' of entries.

Also what happens if there is a page fault on any userpage?
You don't want to be holding a mutex.
