well, that's the reason why I'd like to see it in=20

Mh, nobody has bugged me about that in all those 2 years.  At least I
don't remember somebody asking me for kernel inclusion...=20

Since ipv4 REJECT has now changed

I've started to write a small paper about the envisioned desgign.  It
doesn't look all that complicated, if somebody can concentrate on this
job.  I personally (as indicated before) do not have the time to work on
that issue.  But I'm happy to give advise.

I understand your point.  However, I fear to be the one responsible of
keeping ip6_conntrack in sync with ip_conntrack.  If there is a
volunteer (maybe Yasuyuki?) who would really commit himself to look at
which changes go into ip_conntack, and sending me patches to sync
ip6_conntrack, I'd be more inclined to submit ip6_conntrack to the
mainline kernel. =20
