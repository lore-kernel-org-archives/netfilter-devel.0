Perhaps, though it's not at all clear how it could do that...

I went through TCP related and inet_connection_sock related things, 
nothing obvious I could notice in there...

Do you have net namespaces enabled CONFIG_NET_NS in .config?

Any netfilter (iptables) rules on server which could cause those packets 
to not reach TCP layer?

MIBs might give some clue why those segments didn't get accepted. Most 
interesting ones are PAWSEstab, TCPAbortOnSyn and InErrs. One can use 
/bin/cut to read those from the one-line files if one wants to (however,
I attached a script which transposes them to get them somewhat 
human-readable). Also having the /proc/net/tcp output from the server 
while stalling would be (have been) useful to reveal state info (but I 
should have remembered to ask you to run it on both of them :-)). 

Also, I wonder what that [|tcp] hides, e.g., "<nop,nop,timestamp 
15980976 70381399,nop,nop,[|tcp]>" in tcpdump (and that was for an ACK 
which doesn't make too much sense to me there). It occurs because 
snaplen which was given for tcpdump is small enough to make TCP header 
partial.
