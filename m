Can you be more specific?

h323_buffer is backend storage for skb_header_pointer, i.e.
this will error out early when we ask for more data than is available in
packet.

I don't understand how this could overflow anything.
Even assuming 64k packet we'd still have enough room in h323_buffer
for an ipv6 address, no? (we skip the l3/l4 header when extracting
packet payload).
