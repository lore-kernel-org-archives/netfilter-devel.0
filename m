I think maybe the issue is to define what the end goal is.
For a passive box getting copies of the packets on the wire, ingress 
would be fine. Unfairness would still be there incase the forwarding
box (not the accounting box) actually immediately drops the packet
that has already been accounted for.
OTOH, in what you have introduced you are also accounting for
localy generated packets in a box that is not dedicatedfor just
accounting.
In such a case, we can (if the cost of making the change is acceptable)
make more intelligent decisions.

Suggestion is you just do the marking, let the qdisc do the accounting
on possibly independent accounting table with much more fine grained
locks.

We should probably avoid this approach totaly if we are going to do all
that work.

yes, that would also be a good starting compromise. 
I am begining to question the wisdom of "fixing" this. The clear
solution is to have the contracking code do nothing other
than mark the packets. This is the most valuable thing we can
get out of contracking. Let the tc bits do the accounting. You can still
transport this over ctnetlink. There will somehow need to be signaling
as well from contrack to indicate addition or deletion of marks (other
alternative is to have admin select marks).

Of course all this is a big bait so we can have the energetic Alessandro
do all the work ;-> <wink, wink>

cheers,
