We probably shouldn't be reaching that code since that would mean
that we previously did modifications to the untracked conntrack.
But a quick audit shows that f.i. xt_connmark will do just that.

That also would be fine. However the main idea behind using a nfctinfo
bit was that we wouldn't need the untracked conntrack anymore at all.
But I guess a per-cpu untrack conntrack would already be an improvement
over the current situation.
