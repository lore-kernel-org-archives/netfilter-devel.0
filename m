Ok, actually we were so focused on the classification scheme that we
didn't really try to do something nice for the actions... In a matter of
facts, we have only one action (log) and it is not even implemented.=20

So, we will definitely look at your code to avoid us to have to think
about this part (and avoid to have to recode the actions).=20

Ok, but you are speaking about non permanent rules (aka dynamic rules).=20

The idea we have to handle stateful inspection is to have the core
filter (totally static) plus some "state" nodes placed inside the IDD
which are calling a function to evaluate the "state" of the packet
(based on some informations given by the packet header and a database of
the open connections). When reaching the terminals, one of the action
can be to change the state of the connection.

I guess that what you describe can be handled by such mechanism=20
(better than changing the ruleset each time). As it is handled outside
of the IDD, this take only the time of the look-up in the database and
the time to modify the database (when necessary).

But, I over simplified things here, this scheme is far from being ready
at this point. We should investigate it more in depth (we need more
time!!!).=20

Ok. Could you give more details about the references of this paper from
Lakshman ?

Yes (I messed up things in the following paragraph), you are totally
right here. I totally forgot that you have to deal with rule-overlapping
which is actually making things incredibly sequential).

I am wrong here, terribly wrong. The thing is that is you add a rule at
the end of your filter, you will not have to rebuild it, but inserting a
rule randomly in the list is... bad. For now, we don't have any good
algorithm to insert a rule, so we just rebuild the whole thing.

No.

Users shouldn't be able to break the kernel just by misconfiguring it.

If you are speaking about the "network access verifier", it is something
totally different. But, I might have misunderstood you.

Ok, I think we have to work on the insert/delete part. I know for a fact
that insert/delete inside the IDD is not an option (as the complexity of
this operation is too high), so we will look at some other way to handle
it.

No, Michael and Thomas are from Germany. Mikkel Christiansen is from
Denmark and I'm from France (working in Denmark currently).

We can extend this without any problem.

Actually, as I said, we were just no so concerned about the handling of
the actions, so we just did it in the most natural way (for us). It is a
good sign that we are meeting your very first implementation.=20
