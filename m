(There's a difference between designing code in a way that makes extending it hard and actually implementing other network types, so only implementing IPv4 and IPv6 on a framework that could be extended by anyone deeply passionate about other protocls makes sense -- unless implementing it that way would be so much harder that it's pointless.)

Exactly, and the cost for the kernel subsystem and the userspace low
level part should only be adding the new elements for sending usefull
informations to the userspace and wait for verdict, but the cost for the
'personnal firewall' developper is higher (how this protocol is
interacting with others ? etc etc)

we don't need this at all, as we are in process context, syscall can
sleep.
Trust me, it's strange to have it's web browser freezing waiting for a
timeout if the userspace part doesn't reply, but if it's replying, it's
transparent.
