The struct sk_filter is almost providing the generic framework, it
just needs to be generalized, a quick layout for it:

struct sk_filter {
        struct sk_filter_cb     *cb;
        atomic_t                refcnt;
        struct rcu_head         head;
        char                    data[0]; /* here, you specific struct bpf_prog */
};

The refcnt is required sk_filter_{charge,uncharge,release}. The struct
rcu_head is also need from sk_filter_release().

struct sk_filter_cb {
        int type;
        struct module *me;
        void (*charge)(struct sock *sk, struct sk_filter *fp);
        void (*uncharge)(struct sock *sk, struct sk_filter *fp);
        unsigned int (*run_filter)(struct sk_filter *fp, struct sk_buff *skb);
};

We have to provide the register/unregister functions for the specific
callbacks depending on the socket filtering approach. But I'll have to
introduce this myself when I come up with the nft patches again.

So meanwhile, you should just encapsulate what really belongs to
struct bpf_prog, ie. size, bytecode, jitted, etc. and leave struct
sk_filter in place.

struct sk_filter {
        atomic_t                refcnt;
        struct rcu_head         head;
        u32                     len;
        struct bpf_prog         bpf_prog;
};

The len will go into struct bpf_prog once the generic infrastructure
above is introduced since the semantics (number of blocks) is
different from nft.

If you straight forward rename the entire structure, you'll take
things that are not specific from bpf such as refcnt and rcu_head.
