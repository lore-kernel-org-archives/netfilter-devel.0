Indeed, ugly indeed.

Hm, after having a look at it, I think I prefer to provide some
inconditional sysctl.

Better call it nf_conntrack_enable and set it to 1 by default. AFAICS,
this will be a synonymous of:

iptables -I PREROUTING -t raw -j NOTRACK

This option is disabling conntracking after all. I don't think we
would ever support conntrack with fragments.

Please, send a patch including in the description that we need this
for lxc, I'll enqueue it for net-next unless someone raise the hand
with a better solution.

Thanks.
