Except that invoking get_online_cpus() from an exception handler would
be of course be a spectacularly bad idea.  I would feel better if the
num_online_cpus() was under the local_irq_save(), but perhaps this code
is relying on the stop_machine().  Except that it appears we could
deadlock with offline waiting for stop_machine() to complete and kdbg
waiting for all CPUs to report, including those in stop_machine().

Looks like the current situation is "Don't use kdbg if there is any
possibility of CPU-hotplug operations."  Not necessarily an unreasonable
restriction.

But I need to let me eyes heal a bit before looking at this more.

							Thanx, Paul
