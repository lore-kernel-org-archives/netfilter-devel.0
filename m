I suggest to put the code of that preliminary nfbpf utility into
iptables to allow to read the BPF filters from a file and put them
into the BPF array of instructions. I can help with that.

As said, I'm fine with that, but I'll be really happy if we can
provide some utility to generate that code using backticks for the
masses (in case they want to pass it inlined in that format).
