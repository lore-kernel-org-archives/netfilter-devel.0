Just to bring up the idea: there's no reason why we couldn't make
netfilter fully modular for individual AFs. I've seen quite a lot
of embedded systems that include the IPv6 netfilter core without
using it.

Its rather complicated to get all the dependencies of xtables
modules right though, so this is really just to bring up the
idea.

Your patch looks fine to me.
