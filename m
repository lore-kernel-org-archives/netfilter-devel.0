> The replacing of the destination IP address doesn't occur always.  I've got a PC on which I run a program which retrieves web pages of 30 modems which all have the same IP address.  In order to do this I created the configuration as listed below.  For the program the IP addresses will be 10.9.9.1 to 10.9.9.30.  Those will be send out on a specific VLAN and the IP address will be replaced by 192.168.1.1.  A number of times I get a 'no route to host' for those web pages, this happens sporadically.  If I start looking at the ARP messages, I see that when it goes wrong an ARP message is send out for an 10.9.9.x address which shouldn't be the case.

Please try loading ipt_LOG and executing

"echo 255 >/proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_log_invalid"

and see if something shows up in the ringbuffer.
