gcc 4.4 will have a way to do that per function, but earlier
you would need to move it to a separate file and specify
the option only for that.

Doing so would be still a good idea compared to your
patch because the code will be cleaner and might
be more adaptable to future architectures
(such manual tunings tend to outdate)

It cannot do much without profile feedback because
it has no clue which loops are hot and which are not.

Yes I know, sorry for that.
