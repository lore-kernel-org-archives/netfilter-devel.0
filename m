Based on my understanding from previous discussions ... while the author 
chose to use the term MAC, what is being proposed is less of a 
mandatory solution and more of a discretionary solution as the ultimate 
access control decision resides with the user clicking on the 
allow/deny button versus the system's security policy.  I believe what 
Stephan is proposing is a mechanism which would prompt users (or some 
userspace application acting as a user) to make a decision on specific 
network events such as new connections.

I think it is reasonable to limit an initial implementation to just 
AF_INET[6] sockets.  As you note, if done properly it shouldn't be 
difficult to extend to other address/protocol families.
