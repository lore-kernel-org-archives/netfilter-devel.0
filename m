I just talked about RFC2460.

4.5  Fragment Header

   The Fragment header is used by an IPv6 source to send a packet larger
   than would fit in the path MTU to its destination.  (Note: unlike
   IPv4, fragmentation in IPv6 is performed only by source nodes, not by
   routers along a packet's delivery path -- see section 5.)

Yes, in the case that Linux is IPv6 host.

General speaking, IPv6 router just forwards the fragmented packets and
it's up to IPv6 host to handle them. And nf_conntrack is not packet filter,
but it just tracks packets. So I designed that nf_contrack_ipv6 forwards
fragments to IPv6 stack even if nf_conntrack detects missing piece
of fragments. This resulted in twice reassembly in the case that
Linux is IPv6 host, but I tolerated that.

I think that your improvement can remove such inefficient processing.

BTW, I explained the reason why nf_conntrack does not re-fragment
the reassembled skb like nf_conntrack_ipv4 and forwards the original
fragments to IPv6 stack in
