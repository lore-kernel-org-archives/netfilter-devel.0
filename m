Just to be clear, when a process unshares its pid namespace, it takes
on additional pid nr (== 1) in the new namespace but retains its original
pid nr(s) in the parent (ancestor) namespaces right ?

i.e the process becomes the container-init of the new namespace. When it
exits, all its children belonging to the new namespace are killed too,
but any children in the parent namespace (i.e children created before
unshare()) are not killed.

After the unshare() the process will not be able to signal any children
it created before the unshare() (bc their active pid namespaces are
different)
