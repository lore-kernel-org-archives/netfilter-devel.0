To get rid of the infoleak we have to re-introduce the id field in struct nf_conn
and struct nf_conntrack_expect.
Otherwise have nothing to compare against in the conntrack/expect remove case.

So the only question is what to store, IMHO a counter that can wrap around is the
cheapest method and would also not harm the fast-path.
