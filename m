For nsfd(2) that is doable.  At least for now setns can't restore it.

I have designed these file descriptors to pin the namespaces, so
waiting for them to exit isn't something they can do now.  It makes a
lot of sense to have similar ones that take  weak references to the namespaces
that we can use to wait for a namespace to exit.
