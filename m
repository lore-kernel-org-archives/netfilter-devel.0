Hi Pablo,

please consider this build fix from Eric Biederman which resolves
a build problem introduced in is excellent work to cleanup IPVS which
you recently pulled: its queued up for v4.4 so no need to worry
about earlier kernel versions.

I have another minor cleanup, to fix a build warning, pending.
However, I wanted to send this one to you now as its hit nf-next,
net-next and in turn next, and a slow trickle of bug reports are appearing.
