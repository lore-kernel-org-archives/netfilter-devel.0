Ugh... sorry Patrick, my fault, I've noticed this address in
MAINTEINERS but NETFILTER section contains 3 list so I messed
in which one I should choose. Sorry again.

Actually, the possibility I see is to make some union on _all_
structures I put in pernet section so this union will contain
max possible size of structure allocated and then create one
global slab for this (HW cache aligned). But it would be ugly hack I
believe and until we have no other choise I would prefer to not
play with this idea :)

Yes, I even thought about kref usage here but kref doesn't have a few
function I need.

Ah, thanks a lot! Indeed.
