Fair criticism. My thoughts were that this was a reasonable
middleground between representing masked flags like
"ct_state=0xc2/0xc3" vs. having overly verbose state descriptions like
the corresponding "ct_state=tracked,!new,established,reply_direction".
Either way, we need to represent the three possible states for each
flag: set and we care about the value, unset and we care about the
value, or we don't care about the value. Arguably the example above is
a bit imprecise, because the +trk flows intersect. Omitting the "+trk"
would make all of the return flows intersect.
