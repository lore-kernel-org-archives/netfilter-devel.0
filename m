I'm experiencing RX packet drops during call to iptables, on my
production servers.

Further investigations showed, that its only the CPU executing the
iptables command that experience packet drops!?  Thus, a quick fix was
to force the iptables command to run on one of the idle CPUs (This can
be achieved with the "taskset" command).

I have a 2x Xeon 5550 CPU system, thus 16 CPUs (with HT enabled).  We
only use 8 CPUs due to a multiqueue limitation of 8 queues in the
1Gbit/s NICs (82576 chips).  CPUs 0 to 7 is assigned for packet
processing via smp_affinity.

Can someone explain why the packet drops only occur on the CPU
executing the iptables command?


What can we do to solve this issue?


I should note that I have a very large ruleset on this machine, and
the production machine is routing around 800 Mbit/s, in each
direction.  The issue occurs on a simple iptables rule listing.


I think (untested) the problem is related to kernel git commit:

 netfilter: revised locking for x_tables

 The x_tables are organized with a table structure and a per-cpu copies
 of the counters and rules. On older kernels there was a reader/writer
 lock per table which was a performance bottleneck. In 2.6.30-rc, this
 was converted to use RCU and the counters/rules which solved the performance
 problems for do_table but made replacing rules much slower because of
 the necessary RCU grace period.

 This version uses a per-cpu set of spinlocks and counters to allow to
 table processing to proceed without the cache thrashing of a global
 reader lock and keeps the same performance for table updates.
