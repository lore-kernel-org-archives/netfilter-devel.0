ip6t_ext_hdr is defined by ip6_tables:

net/ipv6/netfilter/ip6_tables.c:ip6t_ext_hdr(u8 nexthdr)

AFAICS the dependency should rely on CONFIG_IP6_NF_IPTABLES.

An alternative is to define ip6t_ext_hdr as static inline in
include/linux/netfilter_ipv6/ip6_tables.h, it's fairly small and it's
invoked in the typical packet path if this LOG is used.

Thanks for reporting this.
