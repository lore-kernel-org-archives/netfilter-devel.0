grep seems to find some other instances of this problem for IPVS.
I would prefer if all of them were fixed.

$ grep -n "= *(.*);" net/netfilter/ipvs/*
After some manual filtering I see

net/netfilter/ipvs/ip_vs_ctl.c:113:     nomem = (availmem < ipvs->sysctl_amemthresh);
net/netfilter/ipvs/ip_vs_ctl.c:279:     ahash ^= ((size_t) ipvs >> 8);
net/netfilter/ipvs/ip_vs_proto_tcp.c:490:       int on = (flags & 1);          /* secure_tcp */
net/netfilter/ipvs/ip_vs_proto_tcp.c:498:       pd->tcp_state_table = (on ? tcp_states_dos : tcp_states);
net/netfilter/ipvs/ip_vs_sync.c:719:    s->v4.type = (cp->af == AF_INET6 ? STYPE_F_INET6 : 0);
net/netfilter/ipvs/ip_vs_sync.c:948:                    cp->timeout = (3*60*HZ)

As mentioned elsewhere: If you would like me to pick up patches for IPVS
then please post patches that only update IPVS files. I'm also happy for
Pablo to pick up patches that include both IPVS and non-IPVS Netfilter
updates of this nature.  Pablo can offer his own guidance here.
