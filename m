I hadn't thought about shared devices - yes that is tricky.

My basic thought is that locks tend to either related to a connection
or the configuration of a service. And it seems to me that if you
have a per-namespace connection hash table then both of these categories
of locks are good candidates to be made per-namespace.

Do you have any particular locks that you are worried about?

No problem. I am a bit busy this week as I am attending the Netfilter
Workshop. But I will try to find some time to rebase your changes soon.

I would prefer the tiny patch approach.
