For working with or just reading kernel sources I recommend getting to
know the cscope tool. Do a "make cscope" and then use one of the front
end browsers.

If you use emacs, then you really should have this set

	; When working on the kernel
	(setq cscope-do-not-update-database t)

otherwise it tries to re-index after every search.

HTH,
