I found a new one: Fedora 16 needs NF_CONNTRACK_NETBIOS_NS (and thus
NF_CONNTRACK_BROADCAST) for firewalld to work correctly - otherwise it
fails when you try to find network printers.

Yeah, it used to be enough to just use a regular firewall setting that
let IPP through, but that was before firewalld "knew" that you need to
also open up the samba port and netbios.

Oh well.

So can you remove the "depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED" from
NF_CONNTRACK_NETBIOS_NS too?

Or should I just do it?
