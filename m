I am coming to this late.  But two concrete suggestions.

1) process groups and sessions don't change as frequently as pids.

2) It is possible to put a set of processes in their own network
   namespace and pipe just the packets you want those processes to
   use into that network namespace.  Using an ingress queueing filter
   makes that process very efficient even if you have to filter by port.

So I don't think you need cgroups to solve this problem at all.
