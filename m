Well, it seems that even a 1MB cache is not enough for this workload, on =

dual Opterons 275 machine.

CPU: AMD64 processors, speed 2205.54 MHz (estimated)
Counted DATA_CACHE_MISSES events (Data cache misses) with a unit mask of =
0x00=20

Yes, but I want to allocate percpu (and per node) data, using vmalloc(), =
not=20
memory on the local node.

OK thanks, I will try this.
