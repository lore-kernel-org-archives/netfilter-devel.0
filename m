Well, INPUT and SOCKET_INPUT are just two different tools that help
solve different classes of problems. INPUT is for filtering all local
traffic while SOCKET_INPUT is just for such that actually has a
listener, and they both make sense in different scenarios.

Of course you can drop certain packets at this point, depending on other
details. Say, for instance, you want to match all packets that are
received by a certain task and that are originated from IP addresses of
a specific subnet, and drop the rest. Rather than adding matches to your
global firewall configuration for all the ports that tasks may or may
not listen on, you can just do it on a higher level, from the
perspective of an administrator. If you decide to let your web server
listen on another port as well, no firewall rule configuration change is
needed at all.

Another use case is accounting. If you want to know how much traffic a
certain service or application in your system has caused, you don't want
to match all its ports to firewall rules just in order to get that
information. Instead, you can now derive that information on a
per-application base. With this patch set, this even works just fine for
multicast listeners, which is something that is currently impossible to
achieve otherwise.

It's currently the only way of realizing application-level firewalls,
and it'd be an awesome feature if it actually worked.

I really don't know if this approach is intrusive enough to make it
qualify as sledgehammer. I'd like to see some real-world benchmarks and
have proof there is a performance decrease for setups that don't use
such chains.

So let's discuss the possible drawbacks.

Again, the deal with this new chain type is simple: if there is no local
listener, the rules are not looked at. If you need rules that are
processed either way, put them in LOCAL_IN, as you always did.

Well, to be more specific: you can only control the resulting error code
that is sent back to the remote peer _if_ there is a local listener. You
can do _anything_ _if_ there is a local listener. This is in line with
the above description and shouldn't cause much surprises for users.

Why so? For deterministic ingress filtering of traffic directed to a
local socket, you can as well rely on information associated with that
socket. And this is what application-level firewall rule sets are all about.
