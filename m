I'm also trimming ;)

In particular, conntrack -E returns an error message when it hits
ENOBUFS, so it's a bad example. Indeed, I think that other programs in
userspace should do this if they don't know what to do with ENOBUFS,
otherwise increase the buffer up to a reasonable limit (set by the
user), and then report that this limit has been reached telling that
they have become unreliable (or depending on the sysctl value that I'm
proposing, tell that they may drop packets).

And I think that there are tons of interfaces that userspace programs
can abuse to do the wrong thing.

conntrack -E is a bad example but I get the point. This sysctl has to be
for all ctnetlink listeners.

And again, you point that this should be per-socket, but how can you
make this option per-socket? The only way that I see to make
state-change reporting reliable is to drop the packet to force the peer
to retransmit the packet and trigger the same state-change, and that
affect all ctnetlink listeners.
