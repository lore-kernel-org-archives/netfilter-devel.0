Actually, the htonll() implementation does not seem to be doing what
cpu_to_be64() is doing.. However, I would assume this is a bug in
htonll() and this change to use cpu_to_be64() is fixing that. Can this
bug cause any major problems in the current implementation?

I would assume that the first index should have had '-i' added to it, if
the purpose is to swap byte order.. The code here is leaving some
arbitrary data in 7 bytes of the 64-bit variable and setting
(u8*)&out[7] = (u8*)&in[7] in somewhat inefficient way ;-). In addition,
this looks more like swap-8-bytes-unconditionally than doing this based
on host byte order..
