Thanks, wait for your feedback on this.

Then, please fix the Amanda helper.

Look, Amanda is an in-tree client of this textsearch infrastructure,
so it's not exposed to userspace, we can fix it.

But if we change the existing behaviour, users may be relying on it
and we'll get things broken for them. Someone else will come later one
with another patch to say: "hey, --to used to be inclusive but this is
not the case anymore and it's breaking my setup".

Please, elaborate.

We have a contract with users that we can't break, so far the corner
case that doesn't work if --from X --to Y where X =3D=3D Y. If that
didn't work since the beginning, then we're 100% sure nobody has been
using it, so let's fix it.
