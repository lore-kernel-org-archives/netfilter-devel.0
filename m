It will be quite difficult to get more details as it's the SMTP relay s=
ever
of Germany's biggest ISP. There's a comment about them
in Patrick's blog from 2008-06-23 if you are curious ;-)

We see the same issue with a MX server from "United Internet".
Normally they are pretty accurate about standards (they run GMX),
so I guess this must be a problem of a router in between.

This is also supported by the fact that 935 of our boxes already update=
d
to kernel 2.6.24.7, yet the problem occured only at three sites and I g=
uess
there are more people out there using that SMTP relay server.

Could you somehow "probe" the servers to see if they normally
send duplicated ACKs by faking/forcing a retransmission?
Though I guess this would invole writing some TCP "test" code.

Thanks for the patch. It seemed to help a bit. Here are two more traces=
:

2

The first connection somehow made it after 400 seconds,
the second one stalled and timed out :-(
Hope they dumps are useful to you.

Chers,
Thomas
