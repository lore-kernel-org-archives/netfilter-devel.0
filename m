Anything to do with socket IO that requires namespace awareness
applies for usage; it could be tcp/udp/etc socket. If it doesnt
make any difference performance wise using one scheme vs other
to write/read heavy messages then i dont see an issue and socketat
is redundant.

If i was to pick blindly - I would say whatever approach with
less syscalls is better even if just a "slow" path one time
thing. I could create a scenario which would make it bad
to have more syscalls.

But theres also the simplicity aspect in doing:
fdx = socketat namespace foo
use fdx for read/write/poll into foo without any wrapper code.
Vs
enter foo
fdx = socket ..
read/write fdx
leave foo.

So if i enter foo, get a fdx, leave foo i can use it in
ns0 as if it was in ns0?
