Hi Dave,

the following patches contain netfilter fixes for 2.6.29:

- a typo fix in a ICMPv6 conntrack log message from Eric Leblond

- a fix for nfnetlink_log per-rule threshold overrides. Currently the
  rule always wins because of the defaults, which is not intended.
  Also from Eric.

- a fix for the nfnetlink_log default timeout units from Eric. The
  kernel uses 10ms units, the default is specified in HZ.

- a fix to avoid conntrack event delivery for untracked connections

- a regression fix from Jan for a problem introduced in 2.6.28: the
  /proc/net/ip_tables_matches and similar files don't include any
  module registered with NFPROTO_UNSPEC. Unfortunately quite large.

- another regression fix from the kernel.org bugzilla: proc file
  addition and removal of IPv4 addresses in recent match have ben
  broken since the addition of IPv6 support.

The patches are also available in my nf-2.6.git tree at:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kaber/nf-2.6.git

I've created it according to your suggestions, I hope everything is fine.
A small warning though: since its based on Linus' tree, it contains a lot
of commits not in net-2.6.git yet.

Please apply or pull, thanks.
