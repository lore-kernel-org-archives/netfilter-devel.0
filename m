The packets in question are shorter than the IP header. How would those be 
delivered to the host? On the LAN it might be possible to forge such 
packets with proper HW address and be delivered. But wouldn't the network 
card or the stack itself throw away the packets??

As the packet is shorter than the IP header, what could be logged, besides 
the fact that something worth to investigate is happening?
