Main problem is that we end up with same ->nfct in both
INPUT and POSTROUTING (br_pass_frame_up vs. br_forward).

its extremely unlikely but reproduceable with something like
hping2 -i u1200 -2 -p 138 -d 128 192.168.0.255

(assuming bridge interface has an address within that network).

Also, with recent change nf_reinject can be run in parallel.
(the original problem was observed on 2.6.32.24, but i can
 reproduce it with nf-next, too).
