	Thanks for catching this bug. Following are my
comments for the patches:

Patch 1:

	I missed the fact that link-local addresses (ffx2) require
binding to ifindex due to __ipv6_addr_needs_scope_id check,
I tested only with a ff05 address. BTW, ff01 is a node-local
address (loopback), you should not use it for IPVS.

	Instead of directly writing into sin6_scope_id we can use
'sock->sk->sk_bound_dev_if = ifindex;' before bind(), it will
work for v4 and v6. Let me know if such solution works.

	You have to send this patch as a bugfix, it should
apply to the net tree and later will go to stable trees (4.3+),
i.e. 4.4, 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7, I don't see stable 4.3 in
https://www.kernel.org/. You should mention in commit message
that this patch is a fix to specific commit (check
Documentation/SubmittingPatches):

Fixes: d33288172e72 ("ipvs: add more mcast parameters for the sync daemon")

	The other patches will go to the net-next tree in
separate patchset but I see little fuzz if patch 2 is applied
without patch 1, so may be this patchset should wait the first
patch to appear in net-next kernel.

Patch 2: looks OK

Patch 3: looks OK

	It was done this way to not exceed the 80-char limit.
May be you can reduce the message for the same reason.

Patch 4: looks OK

	Before bind() such operations should be safe without locks.

Patch 5:

	No need of <> for the commit IDs.

	The indentation of existing pr_info in both cases
should not be changed.

	Patches 1, 2, 3 have coding style warnings from checkpatch
that can be fixed, you can check them in this way:

scripts/checkpatch.pl --strict /tmp/file.patch
