Well, what I worried about was just ease to use, not internal processing.
I suspected that users can correctly configure IPsec and packet filtering.
Just doing "iptables -P INPUT -j DROP; iptables -A INPUT -p esp -j ACCEPT"
will drop all input packets and this is different behavior with current
kernel, for example. So I just imagined many people would say "Why ?".

But as you said in other mail, probably this is my needles fear, isn't this ?
As you know, I'm basically worrier. :)

No. I mean ip6_input_finish(). calling ip6_input_finish() twice causes
problem at processing of IPv6 extension headers. This is different point
between IPv4 and IPv6.

Please note that I don't mean IPv4 processing in your patch has problem.
I think it will work. What I wanted to do was just avoiding double processing
of extension headers and synchronizing IPv4/IPv6 behavior as possible.

Yes.

Ah, indeed. But we can add it just before return directly to
ip6_input_finish().

Of cause that is one solution.
