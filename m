Actually it doesn't seem like much more work to allow changing
table size, the main problem is that sysfs module parameters
don't seem to fit into the network namespace model at all.

Please be more specific about your suspected slowdowns.
What's "everything"? What's different about the hashsize
compared to the many members we already moved to per-netns
structs?
