I think what has changed is:
- We have mostly completed most of the namespace work.
- We have operational experience with the current namespaces.
- We have people not in the core containers group feeling the pain
  of not having some of these features.

So I think we are at point where we can perhaps talk about these
things and finally solve some of these issues.

Clearly how to enter a container is on your and Pavel's mind as big
concerns.  I am aiming a little lower.

I am of two mind about my patches.  Right now they are a brilliant
proof of concept that we can name namespaces without needing a
namespace for the names of namespaces, and start to be a practical
solution to the join problem.   At the same time, I'm not certain
I like a solution that requires yet more syscalls so I ask myself
is there not yet a simpler way.

Hopefully we can resolve something before the next merge window.

Eric
