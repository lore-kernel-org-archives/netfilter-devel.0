IMHO, if the second patch were applied too and we managed to
fix the bug it documents after that, we should not revert it but
apply a new patch along the lines of: "In older versions of the
Linux kernel (< 3.??) ...". I will certainly want applications
developed on future distributions to work properly on my legacy
Debian Squeeze systems (a distribution upgrade or a backport
of the upstream fix to your distribution's kernel may not possible).

For the reasons exposed above I'd rather have the second patch
applied too, but I will defer to you and Michael on that regard.

I will. Thank you. I would appreciate it if you kept me CCed.
