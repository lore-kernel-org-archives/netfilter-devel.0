I never understood that dismissal.

The new rule _will_ be visible as we return to user space. It's just that 
old packets may still be in flight in other queues.

But that is true even _without_ the "synchronize_net()". The old packets 
just had to make it slightly further in the queueing - but as far as user 
space is concerned, there is absolutely _zero_ difference between the two. 
In both cases it may see packets queued with the old rules.

I really personally would prefer the RCU approach too. I don't think 
rwlocks are any more cringe-worthy than spinlocks, although it is true 
that they tend to be slightly more expensive.

The pure RCU "just get rid of the unnecessary 'serialze_net()'" approach 
seems to be clearly superior to either.
