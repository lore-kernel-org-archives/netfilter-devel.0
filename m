Hi Patrick,

Sorry about this.

As it turns out I was mistaken in assuming that the IPVS netns changes
had been merged into nf-2.6. They haven't, they only exist in net-next-2.6.

All of the recent patches that I have passed on to you relate to the IPVS
netns changes so nf-next-2.6 is the right place for these fixes. So could
you please pull the above tree into nf-next-2.6? I do not believe there are
any nf-2.6 changes at this time.

Thanks
