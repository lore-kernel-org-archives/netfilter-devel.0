I'm aware of that. But you're adding a policy knob to control the
behaviour of a one-to-many interface based on what a single listener
(or maybe even two) want. Its not possible anymore to just listen to
events for debugging, since that might even lock you out. You also
can't use ulogd and say that you *don't* care whether every last state
change was delivered to it.

This seems very wrong to me. And I don't even see a reason to do
this since its easy to use unicast and per-listener state.

Only the processes that actually care can specify this behaviour.
They're likely to have more CPU time, better adjusted receive
buffers etc than f.i. the conntrack tool when dumping events.

Its useless since you don't know how received it. It should return
void IMO.

Logging yes, but I can't see the point in perfect synchronization if
that leads to less throughput.
