Yes why not, I can give it a try.

OK I found some minor things, I'll send an updated version back later today.
I will run all my tests it will take a couple of hours.

This is what I have founf so far (before testing)

+	t->dst = (__force u32)
+		(otuple->src.u3.in6.s6_addr32[0] &
+			info->dst_mask.in6.s6_addr32[0]) ^
+		(otuple->src.u3.in6.s6_addr32[1] &
+			info->dst_mask.in6.s6_addr32[1]) ^
+		(otuple->src.u3.in6.s6_addr32[2] &
+			info->dst_mask.in6.s6_addr32[2]) ^
+		(otuple->src.u3.in6.s6_addr32[3] &
+			info->dst_mask.in6.s6_addr32[3]);

Should be rtuple 

+	if (t->proto != IPPROTO_ICMP) {
+		t->uports.p16.src = (otuple->src.u.all & info->port_mask.v32) |
+					info->port_set.v32;
+		t->uports.p16.dst = (rtuple->src.u.all & info->port_mask.v32) |
+					info->port_set.v32;
+	}

in hmark_ct_set_htuple_ipv4() and hmark_ct_set_htuple_ipv6()
Wrong port_mask and port_set, this will work better..

		if (t->proto != IPPROTO_ICMP) {
                t->uports.p16.src = otuple->src.u.all;
                t->uports.p16.dst = rtuple->src.u.all;
                t->uports.v32 = (t->uports.v32 & info->port_mask.v32) |
                                info->port_set.v32;

Thanks Pablo
I realized that I sent wrong version as v12 (v11 with updated comments only), sorry for the confusion.
Basically the changes are the same but you have split it up a little bit more.
