That's a special case where an appl is using 4 ports.
But in general, have not seen other than "on/off" except for above.

In the way that we use HMARK,
in the incomming path there is conntrack disabled in the contrainer, 
for the outgoing patch i.e. at the payloads there is conntrack used.
In that case the --hmark-ct makes life easier.
