Let me layout a few things:

    ..-->classification --> tcaction
return code1 --> enqueue
return code2 ...(packet may be freed here)--> dev.c

The rules are:
1) A qdisc receiving a STOLEN/QUEUED/SHOT signal from the classification
result (return code 1) MUST free the packet and immediately stop
processing that packet.
The infrastructure code will clone packets if they want to steal or
queue it. Infact the skbs flow may even change during this path (eg
packet rewritten)
Billing issues: In such a case multiple packets may be later reinjected
(after replicating the one that was stolen) which totaly bypass
contracking code. Multiple packets may make it out to the wire.
You need to find a way to bill them ;-> (opposite of what you are trying
to do).

2)Return code (return code 2) of qdisc from enqueue function need to be
dealt with care if the packet is localy generated so it doesnt confuse
TCP (SCTP and DCCP sound like two other protocols that could be added)

Here we have two paths:
i) policy dropped packets.
Billing issues: You want to unbill dropped but not stolen packets.

ii) packets that are dropped because of a full Q should continue to
return a XMIT_DROP.
Billing: MUST unbill.

Again as  above shows, billing would work better at the qdisc level.

Linux is being efficient by sharing skbs. One of the most expensive
things in a stack is copying packets around (which is avoided).
If this was a simple system where allocating and freeing can be mapped
to exactly a flow then what you suggest can be done. In Linux you cant.

I am begining to think that all contrack should do is mark the packets
then let the qdisc take care of things.

Cutting email here, since another topic below and this email is too
long.
