I'm not sure you really should set iif here. We usually (tunnels, REJECT
etc) packets generated locally as new packets.

The same applies to mark.

So without conntrack, people may create loops? If that's the case,
I'd suggest to simply forbid TEE'ing packets to loopback. That
doesn't seem to be very useful anyways.

Shouldn't this only be done in PRE_ROUTING/INPUT as stated above?
