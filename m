Well, it seems better to me.

I however think it should be done in ip6_forward()
because "proxying" is done at the router, acting as proxy.
Packets sent to the proxying router are basically forwarded 
to the original node even if the destination is link-local.

On performance issue: as IPv4, we may want to have 
net.ipv6.conf.<if>.proxy_ndisc sysctl.
We may also want to have another configuration 
option (to enable proxy) bacause not all routers require this 
feature.

BTW, would you please give me a few days, till my defence over? :-)
