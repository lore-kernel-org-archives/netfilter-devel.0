How do you disable conntrack per netns ?
I can't see how to do it except for NOTRACK
Then the nf_defrag issue is still there...

True you can't have stateful fw in that stage because of fragments.

Thats why I want to disable defrag and conntrack in them

A single flow, with Containers in any Blade.

    +---------------------------+    /              +--------------------+
--> | FW (no CT)frag  HMARK sel |--->---            | Conntrack and IPVS |---->
    +---------------------------+    \              +--------------------+
            \ (fragments)                                  ..
             v 
         +---------------------------+   /                 ..
         |     de-frag  HMARK sel    |----->  
         +---------------------------+   \          +--------------------+
                                                    | Conntrack and IPVS |---->
                                                    +--------------------+

Note that HMARK makes a preselection of which IPVS to use, and directs the flow
to the same IPVS independent of which Blade/interface it arrives on.
i.e. the defrag:ed packed will reach the same IPVS as the others.
