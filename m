The DNAT mac hack is no longer an issue, can be handled via skb->cb.

Not sure if it can be percpu.  In particular, when we pass frame up
skb can be enqueud in backlog, also we might encounter ingress scheduler
so I am not sure that skb cannot move to another cpu.

Yes, the "put it in skb->cb" also uses this approach, it puts 2bit
"state" information into skb and then removes the pointer.

Ok, I see.  This would work, but I'd prefer to just use the skb control
buffer.

Mhhh, for the *usual* case of "skb is forwarded by bridge" skb->cb
should be safe since we only move skb between bridge and inet(6).

The only "problematic" case is where skb is DNAT'd, then things get
hairy (e.e.g dnat-to-host-on-other device).

> What do you think?

I think that currently it doesn't matter what solution we'll pick in the
end, I'd first like to send all my refactoring patches.

With those patches, it reduces the nf_bridge_info content that we need
to the physin and physout devices, plus a two-bit state in skb.

Then, if you still think that ->cb is too fragile I'd be happy to add
the lookup table method.  For the normal case of bridge forwarding, it
shouldn't be needed though, perhaps we could also use a hybrid approach,
cb-based fastpath for forwarding, lookup-table slowpath for dnat and
local delivery cases.

One other solution would be to use skb->cb but not store bridge device
pointers but the ifindexes instead (we currently don't hold any
device refcounts either so the current method isn't 100% safe either since
such device can be removed ...).
