Hi,

Another round of the patchset to add Netfilter ingress support. This new
patchset introduces the necessary updates in 2 steps:

1) Add minismalistic ingress hook infrastructure that allows to register one
   client at a time, so you hit -EBUSY in case the hook is in use. Basically,
   we have a function pointer that is rcu-protected to invoke the corresponding
   filter framework which has minimal performance impact in the critical ingress
   path and avoid more pollution in it. This patch also ports the ingress qdisc
   on top of this.

   This also results in most of the qdisc ingress code that used to be embedded
   into net/core/dev.c can now be placed in net/sched/sch_ingress.c, which
   should allow to get rid of the Qdisc->enqueue() call.

2) Add Netfilter ingress support using the minimalistic hook infrastructure.
   There is some extra memory consumption (24 bytes) in net_device but pahole
   reports here a hole due to ____cacheline_aligned_in_smp to get the transmit
   path area in a different cache line. So I'm not sure it's worth the effort
   to reduce this to 8 bytes at the cost of getting the hook code a bit more
   complicated.

As already said, this opens the window to existing nftables core features that
are not present in qdisc ingress and that can be used out-of-the-box, most
relevantly:

1) Multi-dimensional key dictionary lookups.
2) Arbitrary stateful flow tables.
3) Transactions.

Among others. You can find more on previous RFCs, see:

http://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg325210.html
http://marc.info/?l=netfilter-devel&m=143033337020328&w=2

In summary, this provides the facility to keep both tc and netfilter in place,
while the user can select what they prefer to filter from ingress.

Thanks.
