Then it appears that simply dropping the packet when the
skb->dst == 0 isn't quite right, since per-frag option processing
wouldn't be done in the case where conntrack is removed, but
the first frag does have skb->dst set  (but not some of the others).

In that case, it appears that conntrack needs to flush the entire
frag queue when it's unloaded. That shouldn't happen much,
so maybe that's not such a bad idea.
