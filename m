This two-liner would indeed trigger a quiescent state on all online CPUs.

However, it would not force RCU to notice these quiescent states quickly.
This is because RCU's normal grace-period-detection path can be thought of
as a state machine driven out of the per-CPU scheduling-clock interrupt
handler.  So RCU would still take another jiffy or two to close the grace
period -- more if there was a partly-done grace period that needed to
complete before a new one could start.

So both Lai's and my patch bypass RCU's normal state machine in order
to not only force the quiescent states, but also to determine that they
have in fact happened.

Hmmm...  I need to ask Jeff Chua what HZ he was running with.  Because if
there was some read-side critical section soaking up 30 milliseconds,
all that hammering will do is slow things down...

							Thanx, Paul
