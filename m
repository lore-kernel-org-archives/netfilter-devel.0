There is likely no "right" answer for this issue, but for what it's worth I can report a somewhat related experience I had a few years ago when updating my PC at home with a new Suse distro. The machine had been running previous versions of Suse with my Comcast cable internet service just fine for several years. I downloaded the ISO from opensuse, burned the DVD, did the install but when it came back up again the internet service was quite unreliable. It would work for a few minutes, but then no packets would flow. I happened to run ifconfig eth0 and it showed an MTU of 576. It seems the version of the DHCP client that came with the new distro honored the DHCP MTU option, but Comcast was advertising DHCP offers with an MTU of 576.

Problem was, the cable modem that Comcast supplied apparently didn't like that short MTU. I found that if I power cycled the modem, packets would flow again, for a little while. When I modified the configuration of the DHCP client to ignore the MTU option and use a fixed 1500, it started working fine like it did before. I suppose the Windows versions of the time ignored the MTU option by default, so this was not something that impacted most of Comcast's users.

The moral of the story for me was that despite what the RFC says, the de facto default MTU of the Internet is 1500 and MSS's derived from shorter MTUs are likely to cause interoperability problems.
