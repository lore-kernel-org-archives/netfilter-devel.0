I'd have thought that the queued fragments would still want to be
resource-counted against the socket (I think that is what skb->sk is for).
So don't really want to orphan skb before queuing them, instead transfer
the entire resource count to the head skb when they are merged.

Although I can't imagine why IPv6 reassembly is happening on skb
associated with a socket.
