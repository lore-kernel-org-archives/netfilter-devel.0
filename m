This is not true, recvfrom() returns the client address and does not
return the original destination. There was a hack in 2.2 kernels, that
it could return the targeted address in the 2nd half of the "struct
sockaddr_in" structure.

But that hack was crude. 

I can only see two options to proceed with full udp proxying: accept()
support for UDP, or a recvmsg() ancillary data (IP_RECVORIGADDRS) as
above.

I'll see whether I can come up with a patch for the latter.

In Zorp we're using accept() for UDP sockets, but I doubt it could be
integrated to mainline, the other option is doable, although potentially
racy.
