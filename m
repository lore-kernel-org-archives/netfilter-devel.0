Yes, I mentioned the 'mutex' name oddity.

Point is :

We want to remove read_write locks. They dont fit the bill.

If performance critical, lot of readers -> RCU (a lot faster)
If not, or too much writers versus readers -> spinlock (a bit faster)

Thats a rather strange and completely wrong claim. A big part of RCU jo=
b
is to have appropriate work done on deletes. Inserts are more easy (onl=
y
needs a smp_wmb())

Take a look at Documentation/RCU/* before saying such things ;)

Not only synchronize_rcu() is not enough to protect this kind of code,
but you need something stronger.
