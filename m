It sounds good. Please take care that IPv6 router does not reassemble
fragmented packets. IIRC the current nf_conntrack_{ipv6,reasm}.c
reassembles the cloned skbs for tracking, discard the cloned skbs after
tracking and forward the original skbs to IPv6 stack to keep the size of
fragmented packets.
