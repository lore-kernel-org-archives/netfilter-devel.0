Again, why is there a need to have both (at same time)?

Please don't accuse anyone of being 'evil'.

I think that tc and netfilter are both broken by design in the sense
that we have two different systems with partially overlapping
functionality while interaction between them consists of hacks.

It works both ways, iptables CLASSIFY target is also not very
elegant from a design point of view, it bolts the packet/connection matching
functionality provided by iptables to qdisc hierarchy.

You mean add 'rmmod nft_ingress' or something similar?

That might be a problem.  One possible way out would be to
make 'tc qdisc add dev eth0 ingress' silently unregister nft ingress
on kernel side (but not vice versa).

Not nice, but it would keep compatibility with tc ingress scripts.

I don't think thats an unsolveable problem, currently we have the
qdisc->enqueue() indirection, now we have hook + qdisc->enqueue() BUT
AFAIU the latter could now be avoided by having ingress hook
interact with sch_ingress directly.

That being said, I am not opposed to two hooks, I just don't see any
technical reason whatsoever why one would need two different ingress
classification engines in use at same time.
