Well, I would of cause be nice to have some "entries" counter, e.g.
listing the number of active conntrack entries created by the SYNPROXY
target, but I don't think it's possible to identify those conntrack
entries, right.
So, I think it would be okay with just a dummy "entries" field which is
always zero.
