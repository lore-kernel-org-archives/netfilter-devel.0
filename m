Sorry for the delay, there were some security bugs so that this lost my
attention.

I did some asking around and the syslog namespace work is dead. There
were some design issues that turned out to be hard to address and the
overall consensus was that use cases like netfilter logging can be
handled in a different way (e.g. using NFLOG target).

Would the patch be acceptable? (It still applies cleanly to current
nf-next tree but I can resend a rebased version if needed.)
