KBUILD_MODNAME is special in that it is derived from the actual
source filename. Of course you could put #define KBUILD_MODNAME "foo"
in your source file, but that is like putting changelogs there
when they belong into the git log.

Well I personally prefer the #include instead of hiding such in 
Makefiles. You know, when newcomers could start doing `grep 
KMSG_COMPONENT *.[ch]`. Perhaps GCC's -include flag in a Makefile
to avoid #includes in .c files?
