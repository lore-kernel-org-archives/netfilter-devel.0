Don't get me wrong, I am not opposing cond_resched_rcu_lock() because it
will be difficult to validate.  For one thing, until there are a lot of
them, manual inspection is quite possible.  So feel free to apply my
Acked-by to the patch.

But it is definitely not too early to start thinking about how best to
automatically validate this sort of thing!
