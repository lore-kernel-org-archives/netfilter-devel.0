Thanks  this was a nice tool.

I played around with that scenario initially but couldn't see any advantage in performance. 
But now I've made some testing with both iperf & httpclient

Hashing is 6 - 10% faster in any combination. 
There was no significant difference by using save and restore mark < 0.6 Mbit/s
