Oh, I see.

How about the forked processes then? Who will be their parent?

Hm... One more proposal - can we adopt the planned new fork_with_pids system
call to fork the process right into a new pid namespace?

OK. Good example. Thanks.

I think this is OK to return -EBUSY for this. And fix the waitpid
respectively not to block this common case. All the others I think
can be stayed as is.

Wait a second - in that case the wait will be blocked too! No?

Well, I'm talking only about the join now.
