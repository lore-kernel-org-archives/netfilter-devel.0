There is no nfnetlink_queue support for the netdev family at this
moment, so this can't be triggered unless you use an out of tree
module.

I have a patch here to add a static key to disable userspace queueing
per family using a static key so that part would be basically
inactive.

But if you really want to see this in 4.1, no problem, please just let
me know and I'll pass it to David, as I said it's basically not
resolving any urgent problem so this is not harming.

Thank you.
