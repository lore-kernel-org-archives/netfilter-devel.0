This patch looks fine to me.

Other than the minor comments I've made the most unhappy I am
with the input patch, and you agree it's grotty too.  Let's look
for a better solution, perhaps with new top-level SKB state,
and then we can put all of your work in after you're made the other
minor fixes I've asked for as well.

Thanks Patrick.
