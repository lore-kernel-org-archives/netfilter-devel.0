Just to clarify, right now this doesn't work:
ping -R <addr-of-bridge>
ping -R <addr-behind-bridge>

Aside from above record-route test I also played with a bogus bridge
setup where incoming packets can exceed br0 mtu, in this case we emit
frag error without echoing/acting on the options.

IP (..  flags [DF], proto ICMP (1), length 1508, options (NOP,RR 192.168.1.1, 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0))
192.168.1.1 > 192.168.1.16: ICMP echo request, id 26676, seq 1, length 1448
IP (..  flags [none], proto ICMP (1), length 576) 192.168.1.10 > 192.168.1.1: ICMP 192.168.1.16 unreachable - need to frag (mtu 1500), length 556

1.10 is br0 IP, 1.16 and 1.1 are on different bridge ports, 1.1 has
bogus (larger) mtu than all other hosts.

The fragment error does not echo any RR information.
Is that your concern?

Why do we need to compile ip options, exactly?  If the packet
is locally delivered, we hand it up to the ip stack which will
compile ip options normally.

If its forwarded, it only travels through netfilter hooks.
The preserved ip_options_compile() call will make sure options
look sane (we don't preserve the built opts information in
this patch).

The only case where it can reenter in fwd case, AFAICS, is when the
skb exceeds the mtu due to nf_defrag (reenter via call to ip_fragment()).

And we used to get crash here when calling icmp_send since skb->cb
was pointing to bridge cb, which then would crash in __ip_options_echo()
because the various IPCB->opts offsets were garbage.

But, why would we want to echo options?

We're just a bridge (so yes, strictly speaking the icmp response
is already wrong, but silently tossing packets doesn't seem right
either).

Are you saying we should act like router and set the options?

True.  I guess in that case, we'd have to resort to less
straightforward approach, i.e. explicitly add the IPCB parts
we wish to retain to br_input_skb_cb, then translate back-and-forth
where needed.

Right.

This patch avoids the option mangling by passing in a NULL skb.
So to do what you want all that is needed is to remember
the parsed opts result.  If we add Erics suggested inet cb pad
we can just place the parsed option struct into IPCB()->opts.

If not, we could add struct ip_options to br_input_skb_cb
and stash it there (we'd still need to re-arrange skb->cb to
what ip stack expects though when calling back into it in output
path).

Alternatively, we could call the ipv4 parsing function again
to re-construct IPCB->opts.

I'm just not yet sure if this is the right idea.
Remembering the information will cause the icmp frag error
above to list br0 ip address in the icmp frag error.

Under which circumstances would we want/need to remember the
parsed options (i.e. retain struct ip_options in ->cb[]), or
act upon them?

Thanks,
Florian
