It creates an expection for the IP parsed as result of the call
forwarding that will expire after 240 seconds. So it consumes memory
but it will expire after that time.

I prefer not to modify this code unless someone using the H.323 helper
reports a problem.

Thanks for your comments. I'll take your patch and extend the
description a bit to explain the current situation of that chunk of
code for the history.
