Some things to keep in mind when doing these changes...
For mobile devices, having the UID/GID is not sufficient when services
are involved (download manager, http service, ...).
Currently, Android's xt_qtaguid netfilter module supports the notion
of "delegation" which is achieved by having the service "tag" a socket
(tracked internally based on the struct sock address), via the file
descriptor, with a UID of who should be blamed for the statistics.
It would be nice if NFQUEUE presented/tracked some data related to the
socket that could be used to that effect.
This tagging of the socket needs to have the following properties:
 - a socket can stay open and be re-tagged (happens when pools are
used or when a stream can be used for multiple reasons).
 - a socket can be tagged with a different UID only if the current
UID/GID/pcap allows for it.
 - an app can have multiple sockets, each one belonging to different
UIDs (so no UID to UID mapping).
There are a few more, but those can be managed outside of the NFQUEUE changes.

Concerning the comment about TCP_TIMEWAIT in some other thread: the sk
is not a "struct sock" but "struct inet_timewait_sock" which is
missing fields. So beware when manipulating it. xt_qtaguid had to
ignore those struct sock.
