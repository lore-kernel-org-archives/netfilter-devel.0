It's still word-wrapped.  You may have to make the patch an attachment,
but see Documentation/email-clients.txt for configuration hints.

It is also not based on the right version; networking patches adding new
features should be based on David Miller's net-next-2.6 tree.

You should also read and follow Documentation/SubmittingPatches.

Ben.
