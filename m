For TC, yes. What Pablo is trying to achieve (and I agree that it's
worthwhile) is multiple things:

* have people use TC ingress as before, obviously
* have people use netfilter, if they prefer
* have them combine both if for some unfortunate reason they require it

Netfilter is based on hook chains. The cost when only using a single hook
is minimal (as Pablo showed in his numbers), but even if only using
TC and a single netfilter classifier chain, there has to be some relative
ordering and the hooks provide this in a generic way.

So I'm all in favour of reduing costs for single or for multi-hook
cases, but it wouldn't be usable for us anymore when doing away with
multiple hooks completely.

One more point to consider is - this is generic infrastructure - the
next person requiring a hook will not have to touch the ingress path
at all. He can register with the hooks, having zero additional costs
for people not using it.
