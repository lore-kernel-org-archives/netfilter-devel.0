joining a preexisting namespace is roughly the same problem as
unsharing a namespace.  We simply haven't figure out how to do it
safely for the pid and the uid namespaces.

Definitely.  I only consider the current interface to be a mushy not
set in stone.

We would want poll to work, anything else is a weird work-around.
The challenging part is that we don't have any infrastructure for
notifying when a namespace goes away.  So that has to be built before
we can wire it up to userspace.  I don't expect it is too difficult
but there is work to be done.
