Dave, the net-next tree seems to be missing this patch...

e1000e: drop lltx, remove unnecessary lock

 LLTX is deprecated and complicated, don't use it.  It was observed by Don Ash
 <donash4@gmail.com> that e1000e was acquiring this lock in the NAPI cleanup
 path.  This is obviously a bug, as this is a leftover from when e1000
 supported multiple tx queues and fake netdevs.

 another user reported this to us and tested routing with the 2.6.27 kernel and
 this patch and reported a 3.5 % improvement in packets forwarded in a
 multi-port test on 82571 parts.
