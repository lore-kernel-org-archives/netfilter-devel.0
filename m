Hey, we are reinventing your brwlock ;-<

The other option is use spinlock, over a smaller area (only counters),
and other mechanism to synchronize on replace.

The counters are the bigger problem, otherwise we could just free table
info via rcu.  Do we really have to support: replace where the counter
values coming out to user space are always exactly accurate, or is it
allowed to replace a rule and maybe lose some counter ticks (worst case
NCPU-1).

The problem is pulling the counter values out of the object in the
replace case. It could be changed to use some form of counting semaphore
like thing but that gets expensive.
