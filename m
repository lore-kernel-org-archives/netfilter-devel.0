Not sure.  There is one case where we must not use device mtu:
if DF was set on one of the fragments, we must not increase fragment
size, thats why I added the MTU argument to make sure that largest
fragment size will be the upper boundary.

I don't see where we break PMTUD or induce any other kind of
breakage after this change.

For the non-df case the original sizes of the fragments
don't matter since any device in the path will (re)fragment.

I didn't claim it wasn't :-]

Thats not as trivial as it sounds.
GRO only aggregates same-size packets.

All the fragments might have different sizes.

Futhermore we need to handle overlapping fragments, duplicates and
arrival of fragments in any order.

Preserving the original skbs and sending those instead of
refragmentation doesn't work either since the reassembled skb might have
been subject to NAT.

So the only possible compromise I see is to record/store all fragment sizes
in the correct logical order (according to offset) and use that as
'replay split points', i.e. we'd still end up not using the device mtu
when undoing the defrag operation.

We'd also not have full transparency unless we would also re-create
the overlapping and duplicate packets that we might have seen, and
send the refragmented skbs in the same order as we received them.

I don't think thats something we want in ip stack, so we'd have
to (re)implement ip (de|re)-fragmentation for the bridge in bridge
netfilter.

Is that what you had in mind?

Or do you see some way to re-use existing implementation without
fuglifying normal defrag operations?

Thanks.
