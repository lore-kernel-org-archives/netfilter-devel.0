Hi Pablo,

please consider this fix for v4.2.
For reasons that are not clear to me it is a bumper crop.

It seems to me that they are all relevant to stable.
Please let me know if you need my help to get the fixes into stable.

* ipvs: fix ipv6 route unreach panic

  This problem appears to be present since IPv6 support was added to
  IPVS in v2.6.28.

* ipvs: skb_orphan in case of forwarding

  This appears to resolve a problem resulting from a side effect of
  41063e9dd119 ("ipv4: Early TCP socket demux.") which was included in v3.6.

* ipvs: do not use random local source address for tunnels

  This appears to resolve a problem introduced by
  026ace060dfe ("ipvs: optimize dst usage for real server") in v3.10.

* ipvs: fix crash if scheduler is changed

  This appears to resolve a problem introduced by
  ceec4c381681 ("ipvs: convert services to rcu") in v3.10.

  Julian has provided backports of the fix:
  * [PATCHv2 3.10.81] ipvs: fix crash if scheduler is changed
    http://www.spinics.net/lists/lvs-devel/msg04008.html
  * [PATCHv2 3.12.44,3.14.45,3.18.16,4.0.6] ipvs: fix crash if scheduler is changed
    http://www.spinics.net/lists/lvs-devel/msg04007.html

  Please let me know how you would like to handle guiding these
  backports into stable.

* ipvs: fix crash with sync protocol v0 and FTP

  This appears to resolve a problem introduced by
  749c42b620a9 ("ipvs: reduce sync rate with time thresholds") in v3.5
