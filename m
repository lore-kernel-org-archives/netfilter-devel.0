	So, sk_lock-AF_INET is locked before calling
ip_vs_dst_event ? Do you have a backtrace for this case?
I assume your patch is tested to fix the problem ?

	sk_release_kernel is called in thread
context, so ip_vs_mutex is not involved there. We
have a problem only with start_sync_thread, right?

	Global mutex protects some global lists such as
virtual services. If your patch works, better way to fix this problem
is to use some new mutex. May be we can move the IPVS_CMD_NEW_DAEMON,
IPVS_CMD_DEL_DAEMON and IP_VS_SO_GET_DAEMON code before the
__ip_vs_mutex locking. This mutex should be used for start_sync_thread,
stop_sync_thread, ip_vs_genl_dump_daemons and IP_VS_SO_GET_DAEMON.
For example, ip_vs_sync_mutex.

	Note that __ip_vs_sync_cleanup is missing a
__ip_vs_mutex lock. We have to use the new mutex there.

	For now __ip_vs_mutex should be global ...
