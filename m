So ping test is not good as the connection tracking entry
is apparently removed once ICMP reply is received.

The one way to reliably to reproduce this is when I'm
sending packets with sendto() from user-land to nbma gre=20
tunnel and specifying the nbma ip address.

=46ORWARDED PACKET, does not hog CPU
----------------------------------

IN=3Deth1 OUT=3D MAC=3Dx:x:x:x:x SRC=3D10.252.5.10 DST=3D239.255.12.42
LEN=3D1428 TOS=3D0x00 PREC=3D0x00 TTL=3D8 ID=3D31320 DF PROTO=3DUDP
SPT=3D34757 DPT=3D50002 LEN=3D1408
	1. mangle:INPUT
	2. filter:INPUT
	3. raw:PREROUTING
	4. mangle:PREROUTING

Next it turns it to GRE encapsulated packet like:

IN=3Deth1 OUT=3Dgre1 SRC=3D0.0.0.0 DST=3Dre.mo.te.ip LEN=3D0
TOS=3D0x00 PREC=3D0x00 TTL=3D64 ID=3D0 DF PROTO=3D47
	1. mangle:FORWARD
	2. filter:FORWARD

Gets proper SRC and LEN at this point and:
	1. raw:OUTPUT
	2. mangle:OUTPUT
	3. nat:OUTPUT
	4. filter:OUTPUT

LOCALLY GENERATED PACKET, hogs CPU
----------------------------------

IN=3D OUT=3Deth1 SRC=3D10.252.5.1 DST=3D239.255.12.42 LEN=3D1344
TOS=3D0x00 PREC=3D0x00 TTL=3D8 ID=3D41664 DF PROTO=3DUDP SPT=3D47920
DPT=3D1234 LEN=3D1324 UID=3D1007 GID=3D1007
	1. raw:OUTPUT
	2. mangle:OUTPUT
	3. filter:OUTPUT
	4. mangle:POSTROUTING

Picked up by multicast routing.

IN=3Deth1 OUT=3D MAC=3D SRC=3D10.252.5.1 DST=3D239.255.12.42 LEN=3D1344
TOS=3D0x00 PREC=3D0x00 TTL=3D8 ID=3D41664 DF PROTO=3DUDP SPT=3D47920
DPT=3D1234 LEN=3D1324
	1. raw:PREROUTING
	2. mangle:PREROUTING

=46orwarded to GRE tunnel.

IN=3Deth1 OUT=3Dgre1 SRC=3D0.0.0.0 DST=3Dre.mo.te.ip LEN=3D0 TOS=3D0x00
PREC=3D0x00 TTL=3D64 ID=3D0 DF PROTO=3D47
	1. mangle:FORWARD
	2. filter:FORWARD

Apparently GRE xmit code fixes it to:

IN=3D OUT=3Deth0 SRC=3Dmy.pub.lic.ip DST=3Dre.mo.te.ip LEN=3D1372 TOS=3D=
0x00
PREC=3D0x00 TTL=3D64 ID=3D0 DF PROTO=3D47
	1. raw:OUTPUT
	2. mangle:OUTPUT

It's starting to smell like ip_gre problem. ipgre_header() seems
to set only the destination IP address. And that probably confuses
the connection tracking code for locally originating packets.

I suppose we should construct almost full IP header in ipgre_header().
