Maybe not.  I just looked and in the vast majority of cases the login
process goes like this.

{
	setup stuff include pam
	child = fork();
	if (!child) {
		setuid()
                exec /bin/bash
        }
        waitpid(child);
        
        pam and other cleanup
}

So an unshare of the pid namespace that doesn't really take effect
until we fork may actually be usable from pam, and in fact is probably
the preferred implementation.  It looks like neither openssh nor login
from util-linux-ng will cope properly with getting any pid back from
wait() except the pid of their child.  It looks like they both with
terminate.  Which means if you login in a new pid namespace (where the
unsharing process becomes pid 1) and call nohup everything will get
killed and you will be logged out.
