Looking at this again, I know uninitialized_var() has been discussed
as not nice since it can hide bugs behind. But if I fix the existing
code to validate priv->op from _init() (this is currently broken), we
can probably use this so save extra code in the packet path for a case
that is not going to happen.

Let me know, thanks!
