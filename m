Is setting the mss to 536 actually ever sensible?
RFC 879 might say that it is the default (and the minimum
that must be supported), but in practise the actual mss
is very likely to be only slightly shorter than the standard
ethernet mss.
Although strict conformance with RFC 879 might require the mss
be clamped to 536, pragmatically a value much nearer 1400 would
make sense - systems with very low mtu/mss are probably likely
to advertise it.
