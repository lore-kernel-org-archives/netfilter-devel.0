And we have to keep the first vtag attempted because otherwise an
attacker could just probe for the right one until she gets a reply.

IOW, if a different vtag is attempted, we should drop it as the packet
doesn't belong to that association/conntrack entry.

As vtags are always != 0 in such case, that's a way to know if we
already have that information or not.

Now it seems swapped, we should save the tag on HB and check on
HB_ACK only and would have to check against !dir entry. Like:

comments with // here are just informative on this email and may not
necessary in the code

 		} else if (sch->type == SCTP_CID_HEARTBEAT)
			if (!sh->vtag || sh->vtag != ct->proto.sctp.vtag[!dir]) {
				/* Invalid */
				goto out_unlock;
			}
 			else if (!ct->proto.sctp.vtag[!dir]) {
 				pr_debug("Setting vtag %x for dir %d\n",
 					 sh->vtag, dir);
				// by saving it on !dir direction, we
				// don't have to enable HB_ACK on that
				// if() above of exceptions, just HB
				// itself
 				ct->proto.sctp.vtag[!dir] = sh->vtag;
			}
			// fallthrough: no action because it's a vtag we
			// have already seen
 		} else if (sch->type == SCTP_CID_HEARTBEAT_ACK) {
			// it's guaranteed tht sh->vtag == ct->proto.sctp.vtag[dir]
			// by the if() of the exceptions above, so we
			// just have to check for vtag == 0
 			if (!sh->vtag) {
	 			pr_debug("Verification tag check failed\n");
 				goto out_unlock;
			}
			// ok, it's hand-shaked, now save it on the
			// other direction too so that further packets
			// can pass that check
			// if there was a vtag crossed some when, we
			// don't care as this one is now established.
 			ct->proto.sctp.vtag[dir] = sh->vtag;
 		}

I was also working on such implementation. Please give me some time to
map one thing to another.
