It definitely is seen as a bug in the context of the alternative,
using 'depend' and then forcing people to spend a lot of time trying
to figure out what magic option they have to enable just to turn
on the driver for their wireless card.

Yes, that would be the way to work around this.

iwlwifi used LEDS and would need a similar workaround.

Maybe part of the problem is the "if NEW_LEDS" construct used
by drivers/leds/Kconfig?  Perhaps we could make this work if
NEW_LEDS appeared as an explicit dependency of the various
LEDS_* options.

Or, maybe it works to make LEDS_CLASS select NEW_LEDS.

I don't know, this is just a gigantic maze, and I'm just throwing out
random ideas.
