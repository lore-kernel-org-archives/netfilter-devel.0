A package sounds something like application. What you want to do is
"packet selection" (like iptables) rather than "package selection"
(like rpm/dpkg). Please "sed -e 's/package/packet/g'"...

Regarding incoming packets, it is impossible to perform packet filtering based
on uid/gid because the uid/gid who picks up the packet is not known until a
user issues accept()/recvmsg(). The socket's owner may change between the
moment iptables inspected the packet and the moment a user picks up the packet
because it is possible to send the socket's file descriptor via Unix domain
socket or call setuid()/setgid().

The only way that makes possible to block access by blockedusergroup is to
insert hooks like http://tomoyo.sourceforge.jp/cgi-bin/lxr/source/net/ipv4/udp.c#L1144
and http://tomoyo.sourceforge.jp/cgi-bin/lxr/source/net/socket.c#L1504 .
But such hooks are not acceptable for upstream kernel. Please see
http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-netdev/2010/7/21/6281491 for
discussion on these hooks.
