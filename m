This would be _additional_ to BM/KMP/naive/finite automata/you name it.
The benefit of libqsearch is hide various algorithms behind a single
interface, isn't it? It's argueable whether it would make sense to try
and rule out bad shifts while parsing a chain of non-wildcard regular
expression tokens but I guess that would be over the top.
