So maybe lets agree to this - we all don't care about Windows 8, but
more importantly, I'd prefer to do one thing at a time and cryptographic
hashing isn't exactly my area of expertise. So lets get these patches
in order and after that I'll look into making SYN cookies perform better
for the poor souls using Windows 8, if that's possible without using
timestamps ;)
