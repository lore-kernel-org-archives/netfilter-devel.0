Hi!

I'm going to reply to Daniel and you in the same email, see below.

I think we have to generalise this to make it flexible to accomodate
any socket filtering infrastructure. For example, instead of having
bpf_func and bpf_func_ext, I think it would be good to generalise it
that so we pass some void *filter. I also think that other private
information to the filtering approach should be put after the
filtering code, in some variable length area.

This change looks quite ad-hoc. My 1-3 patches were more going to the
direction of making this in some generic way to accomodate any socket
filtering infrastructure.

We already have plans to add jit to nf_tables.

I see you have added fp->jited for this. I think we can make this more
generic if we have some enum so fp->type will tell us what kind of
filter we have, ie. bpf, bpf-jitted, nft, etc.

We need this change for if nf_tables. We don't use a fixed layout for
each instruction of the filter like you do, I mean:

+struct sock_filter_ext {
+       __u8    code;    /* opcode */
+       __u8    a_reg:4; /* dest register */
+       __u8    x_reg:4; /* source register */
+       __s16   off;     /* signed offset */
+       __s32   imm;     /* signed immediate constant */
+};

If I didn't miss anything from your patchset, that structure is again
exposed to userspace, so we won't be able to change it ever unless we
add a new binary interface.

>From the user interface perspective, our nft approach is quite
different, from userspace you express the filter using TLVs (like in
the payload of the netlink message). Then, nf_tables core
infrastructure parses this and transforms it to the kernel
representation. It's very flexible since you don't expose the internal
representation to userspace, which means that we can change the
internal layout anytime, thus, highly extensible.

BTW, how do you make when you don't need the imm field? You just leave
it unset I guess. And how does the code to compare an IPv6 address
looks like?

Only root can invoke that code so far.

I was trying to avoid to add some enum to identify to sk_filter to
identify what kind of filter we have there, but this is needed
indeed. Thanks for spotting this.

That won't work for nf_tables, we don't necessarily have to stick to a
fixed layout per instruction like you do, so the real filter size is
obtained after parsing the TLVs that was passed from userspace.

Good catch, I'll fix it, thanks.

I don't like the idea of sticking to some fixed layout structure to
represent the filter, please hold on with it.

That would be nice, but so far I think that we have different
approaches from user interface perspective and, thus, the kernel
design for it.
