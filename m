actually I overlooked it. Thanks for spotting it. I fixed it by copying
it into an int first. However this is only used when you really request
the direction bit and this happens only with hcidump from userspace as
far as I know.

The pkt_type zero is not a valid one. We only use 1-4 and 0xff. So this
can't be the problem. I assume that the cb is not copied from the driver
into the core at some point.
