Hello,

So here's my patch to include the condition target in the existing condition
module.  This patch is supposed to be applied on top of the previous
xt_condition patches I submitted and is intended for 2.6.37 (I'll resend all
the 3 patches when the next tree starts accepting patches again).

One thing that came to my mind was whether it would make sense to rename this
match/target combo to "variable" instead of "condition".  To me it makes more
sense to call it variable than condition, since I have changed the value from
boolean to u32.  On the other hand, it could become very confusing because it
used to be called condition in its xtables-addons days...

Your comments are appreciated!

Cheers,
Luca.
