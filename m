It's going to be NULL if netfilter didn't run because we only instantiate
the on-stack state when it's actually needed and we're going to call
down into netfilter.

Instantiating it unconditionally is not an option, because unless
netfilter runs setting up that structure is a complete waste of work.

Then we have strange semantics where this state thing is NULL,
depending upon whether netfilter was invoked or not.
