Right, the nf_conntrack_confirm() call is still done only if helper acc=
epts the packet.

The issue this patch deals with is that in a fairly typical pattern the=
 packet will be passed through conntrack by a CT action and then recirc=
ulated (for matching on the connection state, using the RECIRC action),=
 and later an another CT action is used to confirm the connection, poss=
ibly with NAT. Before this patch, __ovs_ct_lookup() would have passed t=
he packet through the helper in the first step, while the NAT call woul=
d only happen with the second step, i.e., in the wrong order. With this=
 patch the helper for new connections is called with the second step, a=
fter calling the NAT code (as added by the patch 8/8). For non-new pack=
ets we must call the helper with the first conntrack lookup, as there t=
ypically are no later CT actions for packet belonging to existing conne=
ctions. For new connections we know that if the first CT action does no=
t have the =E2=80=98commit=E2=80=99 flag (which causes nf_conntrack_con=
firm() to be called), we can safely postpone the helper call, as there =
has to be a later CT action for the connection to be confirmed.
