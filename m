Hi Dave,

This is the 6th version of our interface group patches.

The interface group value can be used to manage different interfaces
at the same time such as in netfilter/iptables. The netfilter patch
is ready but future plan is the same for ip/tc commands (except
the ifgroup value change which happens via "ip link set" command).

The first patch is a fix in the rtnl socket interface.

An u_int32_t member was added to net devices indicating the interface
group number of the device which can be get/set via netlink.

The xt_ifgroup netfilter match is for checking this value with an
optional mask.

Other patches are for userpace programs:
 * iptables
 
 * iproute2. Because kernel 2.6.24-rc1 introduced a new enum value,
   IFLA_NET_NS_PID, and it wasn't in the iproute2 code, the first
   patch simply adds this value. The second patch adds support of
   interface group.

Usage:
 ip link set eth0 group 4    # set
 ip link set eth0 group 0    # unset
 iptables -A INPUT -m ifgroup --ifgroup-in 4/0xf -j ACCEPT
 iptables -A FORWARD -m ifgroup --ifgroup-in 4  ! --ifgroup-out 5 -j DROP

Patches:
 [1/3] rtnetlink: setlink changes are unprotected; with single notification
 [2/3] Interface group: core (netlink) part
 [3/3] Netfilter Interface group match
 [iptables]Interface group match
 [iproute 1/2] Added IFLA_NET_NS_PID as in kernel v2.6.24-rc1
 [iproute 2/2] Interface group as new ip link optio
