Damned this broke xt_hashlimit, version=3D0

Look file "net/netfilter/xt_hashlimit.c" line 706

    /* Ugly hack: For SMP, we only want to use one set */
    r->u.master =3D r;

=46ile "include/linux/netfilter/xt_hashlimit.h"

struct xt_hashlimit_info {
        char name [IFNAMSIZ];           /* name */
        struct hashlimit_cfg cfg;

        /* Used internally by the kernel */
        struct xt_hashlimit_htable *hinfo;
        union {
                void *ptr;
                struct xt_hashlimit_info *master;
        } u;
};


So, it appears some modules are using pointers to themselves, what a ha=
ck :(

We probably need an audit of other modules.

(net/netfilter/xt_statistic.c, net/netfilter/xt_quota.c,
net/netfilter/xt_limit.c ...)

Unfortunatly I wont have time to do this in following days, any volunte=
er ?

Thank you

[PATCH] netfilter: xt_hashlimit fix

Commit 784544739a25c30637397ace5489eeb6e15d7d49
(netfilter: iptables: lock free counters) broke xt_hashlimit netfilter =
module :

This module was storing a pointer inside its xt_hashlimit_info, and thi=
s pointer
is not relocated when we temporarly switch tables (iptables -L).

This hack is not not needed at all (probably a leftover from
ancient time), as each cpu should and can access to its own copy.
