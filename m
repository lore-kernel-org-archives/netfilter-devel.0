OK, thanks
I'll will do that.

In a cluster with inputs on many different blades (with a Virtual IP address) you can
receive the fragments on different blades and in that case there should not be any
defrag in that node. HMARK will just produce the same fw-mark for all fragments.

In our case defrag will happens in next hop i.e. before going into IPVS.

As mention earlier, this needs to be documented better.
I will add this to the man page.

Thanks
Hans
