Since in this scenario userspace is able to determine ppp vs pptp, 
could you not also do something like have an inbound_ppp and inbound_pptp
chain, then jump to the appropriate chain depending on type?  If you
need per-interface rules, then create an inbound_pppX chain, populate
it with rules, then jump to that chain if -i pppX.  In ip-down, just
delete the chain as well as the jump.
