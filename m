Make sure that the port for fwmark services is always zero, it seems that
in some cases ipvsadm provides bogus port values for fwmark services.  As
observed by Deon van der Merwe, this manifests as a clients not being able
to connect to the virtual service if persistence is set.

I believe that this fixes a bug and as such is suitable for -stable.
However, Its taken a few release for anyone to bring this to our attention,
so it doesn't seem to be causing much pain in the wild.
