I do not mind who is hosting what parts, as git repos can be
transferred easily, but I strongly suggest not to decouple xt_mp2t
from (any clone of) the xtables-addons structure base, because doing
so would bring you back to square one with regard to maintenance.

I recognize you may dislike splitting up the IPTV codebase, so I
propose that you make use of submodules, and have an Xt-a clone as
one submodule. That would allow merging in both directions.
