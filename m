Personally I would disagree.  Something like:

  if (list_is_first(&rq->queuelist, &nd->queue))

is much more readable to me than:

  if (rq->queuelist.prev == &nd->queue)

The first one takes no effort for me -- it's almost English.  While the
second one takes me a few seconds (and some precious brain cycles) to
decipher.

Maybe whether it's readable depends on how many years you've been
looking at the pattern.  But IMHO we shouldn't make "having x # of years
staring at kernel code" a prerequisite for being able to read kernel
code.
