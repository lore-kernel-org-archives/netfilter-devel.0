The helper name change is fine. We currently have a limit of 30
in the helper match, but that is just as arbitrary and 16 does
seem like enough. In fact I need the same change for nftables :)

These patches look almost perfect, there's just one minor thing
that should be fixed from my perspective (from patch 4):

Its preferrable not to use module reference counting during packet
processing, the protocols can be accessed safely using RCU. I thought
I had fixed all those areas, but I now notice that ctnetlink is full
of similar spots and takes and drops module references quite
excessively. So just leave it as it is I guess, this should be fully
fixed anyways.

I'll wait a few hours for others to comment before applying your
patches.
