skb_checksum_help() does:

	if (unlikely(skb_shinfo(skb)->gso_size)) {
		/* Let GSO fix up the checksum. */
		goto out_set_summed;
	}
...
out_set_summed:
	skb->ip_summed = CHECKSUM_NONE;
out:
	return ret;

but skb_gso_segment() requires that skb->ip_summed == CHECKSUM_PARTIAL
and WARNs if not.  I don't think there's any case where it's valid to
call both.  Shouldn't skb_checksum_help() also WARN and return an error
code instead of muddling on?

Inspecting the callers of skb_checksum_help(), it looks like sch_netem's
'corrupt' option and xt_CHECKSUM might trigger this case.

Ben.
