Logically I think that this makes more sense residing within
__ovs_ct_lookup() and actually populating skb->{nfct,nfctinfo} prior
to making this call to skb_nfct_cached() which answers the question
"Is skb->nfct the same as if I did a lookup?". Maybe a better name for
this function is something like ovs_ct_cmp() as it compares the skb's
nfct against the OVS structures.

The call to nf_ct_get() could move out into __ovs_ct_lookup(), then
just pass the 'ct' into here. I see that a later patch already adds
another call to nf_ct_get() into __ovs_ct_lookup(), which should only
be necessary in the case where it is not already cached.
