My suggestion was to queue up a dummy 'struct migration_req' up with 
it (change migration_req::task == NULL to mean 'nothing') and simply 
wake it up using wake_up_process().

That will force a quiescent state, without the need for any extra 
information, right?

This is what the scheduler code does, roughly:

                wake_up_process(rq->migration_thread);
                wait_for_completion(&req.done);

and this will always have to perform well. The 'req' could be put 
into PER_CPU, and a loop could be done like this:

	for_each_online_cpu(cpu)
                wake_up_process(cpu_rq(cpu)->migration_thread);

	for_each_online_cpu(cpu)
                wait_for_completion(&per_cpu(req, cpu).done);

hm?
