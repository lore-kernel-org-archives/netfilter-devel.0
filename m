Actually, the state object can be useful to resolve the major bug in
actions that mangle skbs in an illegal way, as we can use it to pass
back to the ingress path the new skb_shared_check()'ed skb.

The genericity that they state object introduces comes with a cost, no
doubt, but it helps to extend things later on and resolve tricky
situation like the one above without large patches to propagate new
state information that you need all over the code.

Regarding the performance argument that is repeating over and over
again, we all here are quite aware here that there's is a *good room
for improvement* in qdisc ingress itself...
