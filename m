Thanks! That was my concern too.  One huge and very complex patch is not
a nice thing to have. ;)

Ahh, sure! I missed the actual point of Patrick's question.  I had the
idletimer_tg_create() inside the lock, but when I added the
sysfs_create_file() there (which can sleep), I screwed up with the
locking.

I'll move the sysfs file creation to outside that function so I can keep
the lock until after the timer is added to the list.  Thanks for
clarifying!
