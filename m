It's more than a mess. Leaving aside the fully broken code at ingress,
just look at the TC action APIs. Its "a failed state". TC is as well, but
on egress only on the userspace side - Thomas's presentation 'TC - -EWTF'
IIRC put it quite well. Our long term goal is to fix both, but ingress is
actually simply, for any realistic case (though my experience is limited),
meaning you have more than a single classifier, some structure in your rules
and more than a single CPU, we'll do better right now.

But Alexey's point is well taken. If we can't manange to add our hooks
without impacting existing use cases, we'll try better until we can.
The single hook case seems to be possible to optimize at the benefit of
all the layers quite easily, and for people using both, we'll try to
compete on a different level.
