Pushing buffer to userspace and wait for userspace's decision will sleep.
sk_filter() which calls security_sock_rcv_skb() hook is called from
(e.g.) tcp_v6_do_rcv() and comment of tcp_v6_do_rcv() says that
"The socket must have it's spinlock held when we get here." 
Also, comment of rxrpc_queue_rcv_skb() says that
"the caller must hold a lock on call->lock".
I think it is not permitted to do sleeping operation inside
security_sock_rcv_skb().
