I hold changes in my tree for a week or more, because I want them to
"cook" there before they go to Linus.

So if it takes a week or two for a bug fix like this to propagate into
Linus's tree, that's just what sometimes happens.

In the mean time you can apply the fix locally if you absolutely have
to have it right at this moment, that is the freedom that everyone
has.

FWIW, I plan to push my tree to Linus some time today, so this will be
resolved in the next day or so.

Thanks.
