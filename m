Yes, those pesky humans, you give them an inch and they want a mile ;->
I think 32 for example is better than 1. So if you use a u32 variable
doesnt pollute the netdevice that much - and used as a bitmap, then
setting any of the 32 bits implies the device is in that group. This of
course limits the group ids to be (1..32). Your mileage may vary.

nice.
The part that is not very useful today with ifconfig or ip link ls is i
have only two choices: Either i ask for all devices or for one; i cant
ask for something in the middle. If i can group them together then i can
solve that problem sith some user space plumbing (which avoids 10K
netlink messages). 
"get ppp*" may actually be a totally separate call which also traverses
the list in the kernel and just returns the matching devices. 

cheers,
