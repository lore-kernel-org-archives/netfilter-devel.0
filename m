I have read the OLS paper on virtualization, it states that the current
state of affairs is that struct net_device will be assigned to one
specific namespace. As my change changes struct net_device itself, I
expect to work without problems when virtualization comes, the interface
group can be interpreted on a per-namespace basis.

There probably will be several iptables rulesets when the time comes,
one for each namespace, but again, struct net_device will be assigned to
a namespace, and the proper iptables tables will be iterated based on
the net_device assignment.

Am I missing something?
