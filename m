I think that, with a little bit more work, you can add support for
IPv6 as well. From RFC 3173:

"In the IPv6 context, IPComp is viewed as an end-to-end payload, and
MUST NOT apply to hop-by-hop, routing, and fragmentation extension
headers.

You can perform that IPv6-specific handling to skip these extension
headers and reach the IPComp header by means of the ipv6_find_hdr()
helper function.

BTW, please post the iptables userspace part as well.
