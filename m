If it were the user of the slab who was invoking some variant of
call_rcu(), then I would agree with you.

However, call_rcu() is instead being invoked by the slab itself in the
case of SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU, so that there is no variation in usage.
Requiring that the user call rcu_barrier() is asking for subtle bugs.
Therefore, the best approach is to have kmem_cache_destroy() handle
the RCU cleanup, given that this cleanup is for actions taken by
kmem_cache_free(), not by the user.
