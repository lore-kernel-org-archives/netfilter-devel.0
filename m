Are we sure of the same hash distribution? Probably I miss something,
but: if this 'hash' is well distributed on 32 bits, and ht->cfg.size
is smaller than 32 bits, e.g. 256 (8 bits), then this multiplication
moves to the higher 32 of u64 only max. 8 bits of the most significant
byte, and the other three bytes are never used, while division is
always affected by all four bytes...
