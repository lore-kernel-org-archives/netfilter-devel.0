Thanks for the explanation. It might help to document the role of bh
disabling for the reader in a supplementary code comment, otherwise one
might think it's been put there to match the bottom half disabling used
on the write-side, which has the supplementary role of making sure bh
will not deadlock (and this precise behavior is not needed usually on
the read-side).

One more point :

 *    1. reading counter values
 *       all readers need to be stopped and the per-CPU values are summ=
ed.

Maybe it's just me, but this sentence does not seem to clearly indicate
that we have :

for_each_cpu()
  write lock()
  read data
  write unlock()

One might interpret it as :

for_each_cpu()
  write lock()

read data

for_each_cpu()
  write unlock()

Or maybe it's just my understanding of English that's not perfect.
Anyhow, rewording this sentence might not hurt. Something along the
lines of :

"reading counter values
 all readers are iteratively stopped to have their per-CPU values
 summed"

This is an important difference, as this behaves more like a RCU-based
mechanism than a global per-cpu read/write lock where all the write
locks would be taken at once.
