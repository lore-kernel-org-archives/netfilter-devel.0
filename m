(There's a difference between designing code in a way that makes extending it hard and actually implementing other network types, so only implementing IPv4 and IPv6 on a framework that could be extended by anyone deeply passionate about other protocls makes sense -- unless implementing it that way would be so much harder that it's pointless.)

I hate to be the one to say this, but it looks to me as if the
easiest way to solve the problems that you have outlined would
be to create a new LSM based on SELinux with two important
changes. The first would be to have a separate policy for each
user (or process tree) and the second would be to make the policy
specification discretionary. SELinux has all the mechanism you're
talking about, but you want the policy being enforced to reflect
a set of "personal firewall" rules rather than "domain type" rules.
 From the lobby at LCA in Hobart these rule sets are pretty hard to
tell apart. And let's not have the "SELinux isn't designed to do
that" row. Of course it isn't. Nonetheless, the personal firewall
sure sounds a lot like SELinux if you ignore the MAC/DAC difference.
