I'm happy to announce the first official release of the IPTV-Analyzer
project, as an Open Source project.

 Homepage:
  http://www.iptv-analyzer.org

 Git tree:
  https://github.com/netoptimizer/IPTV-Analyzer

The IPTV-Analyzer is a continuous/real-time tool for analyzing the
contents of MPEG2 Transport Stream (TS) packets, which is commonly
used for IPTV multicast signals. The main purpose is continuous
quality measurement, with a focus on detecting MPEG2 TS/CC packet
drops.

The core component is an iptables (Linux) kernel module, named
"mpeg2ts".  This kernel module performs the real-time Deep Packet
Inspection of the MPEG2-TS packets. Its highly performance optimized,
written for parallel processing across CPU cores (via RCU locking) and
hash tables are used for handling large number of streams. Statistics
are exported via the proc filesystem (scalability is achieved via use
of the seq_file proc API).  It scales to hundreds of IPTV channels,
even on small ATOM based CPUs.
