Such packets are cloned or copied. I am going to assume the contrack
data remains intact in both cases. LaForge?
BTW, although i mentioned the multiple interfaces as an issue - thinking
a little more i see retransmissions from TCP as well (when enqueue drops
because of full queue) being a problem. 
Haralds patch bills in that case as well for each retransmitted packet
that gets dropped because of full Q.
So best place to really unbill is at the qdisc level.
The only place for now i see that happening is in the case of drops
i.e sch->stats.drops++ 
The dev.c area after enqueue() attempt is a more dangerous place to do
it at (incase the skb doesnt exist because something freed it when
enqueue was called. Also because thats one area open for returning more
intelligent congestion level indicating codes)

That is the challenge at the moment.
For starters i dont see it as an issue right now to do locking.
Its a cost for the feature since Haralds patch is in. 

In the future we should make accounting a feature that could be turned
on despite contracking and skbs should carry an accounting metadata with
them.

No i think your idea is valuable.
The challenge is say you have a million connections, then do you
have a million locks (one per structure)? I think we could reduce it
by having a pool of stats sharing a lock (maybe by placing them in a 
shared hash table with each bucket having a lock).
You cant have too many locks and you cant have too few ;->


On your qdisc you say:

If qdisc drops on full Q and unbills i think it should work, no?
If it drops because they abused a bandwidth level, shouldnt you punish
them still? I think you should, but your mileage may vary.
Note you also dont want to unbill more than once. If not maybe you can
introduce something on the skb to indicate unbilling-happened (if done
by policer) so root qdisc doesnt unbill again.

I think the issue starts with defining what resource is being accounted
for. In my view, you are accounting for both CPU and bandwidth.
Lets start by asking  What is the resource being accounted for?

I think i understand.
A packet that gets enqueued is _guaranteed_ to be transmitted unless
overulled by admin policy. 
Ok, how about the idea of adding skb->unbilled which gets set when
unbilling happens (in the aggregated stats_incr()). skb->unbilled gets
zeroed at the root qdisc after return from enqueueing.

cheers,
