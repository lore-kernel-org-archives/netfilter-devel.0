It checks if it might be the entry we're looking for.

If this was complete random garbage, scheme would not work, as then
we could have entry that isn't in table, has nonzero refcount, but
has its confirmed bit set.

I don't see how that would be possible, any reallocation
makes sure ct->status has CONFIRMED bit clear before setting refcount
to nonzero value.

I think this is the scenario you hint at is:
1. nf_ct_key_equal is true
2. the entry is free'd (or was already free'd)
3. we return NULL to caller due to atomic_inc_not_zero() failure

but i fail to see how thats wrong?

Sure, we could restart lookup but how would that help?

We'd not find the 'candidate' entry again.

We might find entry that has been inserted at this very instant but
newly allocated entries are only inserted into global table until the skb that
created the nf_conn object has made it through the network stack
(postrouting for fowarded, or input for local delivery).

So, the likelyhood of such restart finding another candidate is close to 0,
and won't prevent 'insert race' from happening.
