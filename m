I have a similar patch here that I sent time ago, I'll send it again, I
think that we can merge your patches and mine.

I'm not sure about this. Instead, I noticed with oprofile that we spend
more cycles to calculate the message size. I think it's more like a
trade-off, reducing the message size to what we need reduces the chances
to hit ENOBUFS.

I'm fine with the helper size change. Actually the current size of 30
bytes doesn't make too much sense.
