I see that I misread part of what you wrote.

We cannot use percpu data for nf_bridge_info; at least its not trivial
to do (I tried).

Main issues are:
- nfqueue (we have to save/restore info)
- local delivery (skb is enqueued in backlog)
- skb is dropped (we need to reset scratch data)
- DNAT mac hack (skb can be queued in qdisc).

We _can_ use percpu data for passing the original mac
header to the ip_fragment output function.  But, as mentioned,
there is a patch in netdev patchwork that adds extra output
parameter for use with OVS so it seems cleaner to (re-) use common
api in both OVS and br netfilter.

Right, thanks for catching this.

Sorry -- I'm dense -- what typo? :-)
