Florian has added a new native interface to integrate helpers into
nftables in a much better way than we do now, that allows much more
fine grain configuration. This new interface bumps refcounts on
helpers as you suggest.

However, we still have to sort of keep the existing behaviour around,
people has been relying on this rmmod feature to globally disable
helpers. It's very old thing indeed and as you can see, very sparse
grain for the netns era... But still I think we need this.

So I'm inclined to take this, and keep an eye to deprecate this
behaviour in a several years ahead once. Probably we can get rid of
this barrier at some point.
