I didnt quiet follow how i could use the above to do:
"ip ns <name/id> route add blah" from namespace0.

I tend to think in packets and wires instead of files;
How about just allowing a "control" channel from which
i could discover the namespace?
Example, assuming i have the right permissions:
1) listen to async events example on a multicast bus when
a namespace is created or destroyed. Provide me a little more info on
the created namespace such as its pid, name(?), types of namespace, etc
2) send a query to dump existing namespace or query by name, id etc.
I get the same details as above.

using genetlink should provide you with sufficient ability to do this.

cheers,
jamal
