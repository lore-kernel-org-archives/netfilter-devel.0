It's bad to forward uncompleted fragments to IPv4/IPv6 stack.

One the one hand, helper modules of conntrack analyze application data
in packets. They need to parse overall segment or datagram. If packets are 
fragmented, conntrack needs to reassemble them.

On the other hand, if uncompleted fragments are forwarded to IPv4/IPv6 stack,
they will be reassemble twice, and the result is also failure.
So, conntrack will drop uncompleted fragments after reassemble timeout.

Yes, the defragment implement of IPv6 conntrack is absolutely different from that of IPv4 conntrack.
But, the handle after reassemble timeout should be consistent.
For IPv4 conntrack, an end host with conntrack enabled must send ICMP fragment reassembly timeout
message to source host. Details see commit e9017b
(Title: IP: Send an ICMP "Fragment Reassembly Timeout" message when enabling connection track).
