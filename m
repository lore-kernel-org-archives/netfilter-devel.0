> 
> * Three patches with improvements and code refactorization
>   for nfnetlink_queue, from Florian Westphal.
> 
> * FTP helper now parses replies without brackets, as RFC1123
>   recommends, from Jeff Mahoney.
> 
> * Rise a warning to tell everyone about ULOG deprecation,
>   NFLOG has been already in the kernel tree for long time
>   and supersedes the old logging over netlink stub, from
>   myself.
> 
> * Don't panic if we fail to load netfilter core framework,
>   just bail out instead, from myself.
> 
> * Add cond_resched_rcu, used by IPVS to allow rescheduling
>   while walking over big hashtables, from Simon Horman.
> 
> * Change type of IPVS sysctl_sync_qlen_max sysctl to avoid
>   possible overflow, from Zhang Yanfei.
> 
> * Use strlcpy instead of strncpy to skip zeroing of already
>   initialized area to write the extension names in ebtables,
>   from Chen Gang.
> 
> * Use already existing per-cpu notrack object from xt_CT,
>   from Eric Dumazet.
> 
> * Save explicit socket lookup in xt_socket now that we have
>   early demux, also from Eric Dumazet.
