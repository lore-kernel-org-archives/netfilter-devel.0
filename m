Indeed, I'm doing some trimminng :)

As I already said, "conntrack -E" used for debugging. Nobody cares
whether it misses a few events instead of causing dropped packets.
Whether its on or not by default is secondary to being the right
thing at all.

I don't doubt that, I question the mechanism.

Yes, and you don't need to if you don't want "reliable" logging.
The point is that you can choose per socket. Only if a socket that
really wants this doesn't get a copy you drop.

No, its not the same. ctsync sets big receive buffers and requests
"reliable" delivery, "conntrack -E" does nothing special and doesn't
care whether messages are dropped because its receive queue is too
small.

You keep saying that, but its only the case because the way you
implemented it requires this. Why would ctsync care whether
conntrack -E missed a packet?

Again, I'm not arguing about the option but about making it a
sysctl or something that affects all (ctnetlink) sockets whether
they care or not. You could even make it a per-broadcast listener
option, but the sysctl is effectively converting broadcast
operation to reliable unicast semantics and that seems wrong.
