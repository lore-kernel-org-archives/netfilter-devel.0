We found a workaround by putting a linux-based AVM fritz!box router between 
kernel 2.6.25.10 and the mailserver, now the TCP connection works again,
though it gets NATed. Still can't make any sense out of this.

On another box which showed similar behaviour,
upgrading from 2.6.24.7 to 2.6.25.10 solved the issue.
