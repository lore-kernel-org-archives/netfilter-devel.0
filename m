We can add a global perns limit in terms of conntrack entries that can
only be set via CAP_NET_ADMIN from the initns. Thus, we avoid the
filling/blocking from another netns, or hide this knob to
unpriviledged userns somehow.

In the previous netfilter workshop I remember we agreed on going
towards having a single conntrack table for netns, so I suggest we
follow that direction.
