Correct, walker may not see "another insertion". The window for this
behavior to occur is not the full resize operation, just the linking
period, but it may occur. The length of the window is typically
equal to a grace period.

We can provide a synchronization function to block the dumper or the
insertion/removal until the linking is complete. The latter would
give the old runtime behaviour back (variable runtime of insert),
the blocked dumper might be preferred. What do you think?
