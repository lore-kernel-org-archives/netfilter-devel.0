The second patch is more speculative and aims to be a more general
workaround, as well as a performance optimization: support
(preferably JIT compiled) BPF programs as iptables match rules.

Potentially, the skb->priority match can be implemented by applying
only the second patch and adding a new BPF_S_ANC ancillary field to
Linux Socket Filters.

I also wrote corresponding userspace patches to iptables. The process
for submitting both kernel and user patches is not 100% clear to me.
Sending the kernel bits to both netdev and netfilter-devel for
initial feedback. Please correct me if you want it another way.

The patches apply to net-next.
