I'm afraid we cannot just get rid of that !ipv6_ext_hdr() check. The
ipv6_find_hdr() function is designed to return the transport protocol.
After the proposed change, it will return extension header numbers.
This will break existing ip6tables rulesets since the `-p' option
relies on this function to match the transport protocol.

Note that the AH header is skipped (see code a bit below this
problematic fragmentation handling) so the follow up header after the
AH header is returned as the transport header.

We can probably return the AH protocol number for non-1st fragments.
However, that would be something new to ip6tables since nobody has
ever seen packet matching `-p ah' rules. Thus, we restore control to
the user to allow this, but we would accept all kind of fragmented AH
traffic through the firewall since we cannot know what transport
protocol contains from non-1st fragments (unless I'm missing anything,
I need to have a closer look at this again tomorrow with fresher
mind).
