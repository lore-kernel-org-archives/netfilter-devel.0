There probably should be at most one copy per NUMA node. Maybe less, 
depending on what the benchmarks will say.

I started on some patch to reduce the ruleset from #cpu to #numa_nodes, 
but then stopped when I ran into the obvious fact that it would require 
locking the counters because xtables can actually run on more than one 
core within a given numa node. When decoupling counters from the 
ruleset, reducing the ruleset copies would become easier.
