I agree that it doesn't belong to the generic networking code.
But the way its handled in netfilter is far from perfect as well.
Currently multiple modules will spam the ringbuffer repeatedly,
but offer no possibility to change anything in the behaviour of
how these packets are treated. Unfortunately we can't handle this
in the ruleset (which is exactly the reason why we're spamming
the ringbuffer), so how about we add a module option controlling
how to treat those packets and remove the printk?

In the case of conntrack I would even argue that the message
makes no sense at all since tracking doesn't matter as long as
the state isn't used. And for that the table code can warn or
offer controls.
