Just to clarify: I think the actual *users* are worth doing one by
one, particularly if there are user-specific explanations of what that
particular code wanted, and why spin_unlock_wait() doesn't really
help.

And I think that you actually have those per-user insights by now,
after looking at the long thread.

So I'm not saying "do one patch for the whole series". One patch per
removal of use is fine - in fact preferred.

But once there are no actual more users, just remove all the
architecture definitions in one go, because explaining the same thing
several times doesn't actually help anything.

In fact, *if* we end up ever resurrecting that thing, it's good if we
can resurrect it in one go. Then we can resurrect the one or two users
that turned out to matter after all and could come up with why some
particular ordering was ok too.
