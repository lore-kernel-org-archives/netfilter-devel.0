I did a test, and its indeed a bit faster to use rb_first(), by about 5%

Real win is to be able to build a chain using rb_first()/rb_next(),
(leaving the tree as is), then deleting the items in the chain, and
simply reset rb_root.

This only needs to reuse one pointer to store the item->next pointer.

This is then about ~50% faster, because we do not constantly rebalance
tree for every removed item.
