I agree.  Client systems should start with the smallest possible table
size and memory usage (just enough for dozens or hundreds of
connections), and possibly never grow past that.  Any system processing
a non-trivial number of connections, however, wants to very quickly grow
to a substantial number of buckets.  The unzipping algorithm works just
fine for any integer growth factor; it just gets a bit more complicated.

One nice thing is that the resize algorithm very quickly allocates the
new buckets and sets up the head pointers such that the new table can be
used for inserts almost immediately, *without* a synchronize_rcu.  Only
the bucket unzipping process takes a non-trivial amount of time
(including one or more synchronize_rcu calls).  And the newly inserted
entries will go directly to the appropriate buckets, so they'll take
advantage of the larger table size.

If we have a means of tracking the number of inserts, we already have
the ability to make the decision, which is just a single comparison.  No
need to batch, since the decision of whether to check would *also*
require a comparison.

I do think this should just use the same growth function everywhere
until a user comes along that needs something different.
