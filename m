THIS is what I did at the beginning. But is seem me to be some thing
wrong. So I put a static value in skb->tstamp  instead of
ktime_get_real() for debug purpose. And I was still becoming the
amount of second, microsecond since 1970. We are back to my initial
mail ! The value of skb->tsamp doesn't seems to be returned by
ioctl().
