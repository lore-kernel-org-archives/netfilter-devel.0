You can use my nf-next.git tree from:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kaber/nf-next-2.6.git

It contains the lock free counters, as well as smaller optimizations
from Eric. The last timer patch I've seen missed the actual conversion
to use mod_timer_pending(), but it would be great to have some numbers
on the conntrack lock changes. Thanks Rick!
