Hi again,

Here is the xt_condition patch, hopefully for inclusion this time.

When these patches get accepted, I'll send the implementation of the condition
target, as discussed before.

In RFC v2 I've made a few changes as discussed in the review:

  * Removed per-netns module parameters
  * Use par->net instead of current->nsproxy->net_ns
  * Fix file-leak in procfs when exiting the netns

I didn't get any more comments in RFC v2, so I assume it is okay to send it for
inclusion.

>From [RFC v2] to [PATCH], I've only rebased and added a new patch to support
u32 instead of boolean as the value for the condition.

Cheers,
Luca.

PS: I've been on vacation, that's why it took sometime to submit this patch again.
