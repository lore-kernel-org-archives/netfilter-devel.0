Looking at the initial command, I would say this bug report is actually
of the same origin as ours.

It is cleaned from the list but as it is an RCU list, other readers can
still be holding pointers to it. We have to wait for the RCU grace
period before we can reuse it.

That was also my first idea. However, nf_nat_cleanup_conntrack() is
called from __nf_ct_ext_destroy() inside a rcu_read_lock() /
rcu_read_unlock() block. Even if this block is for a different RCU list,
we still cannot call synchronize_rcu() while inside it.

We could call synchronize_rcu() in __nf_ct_ext_destroy() after
rcu_read_unlock() but this would IMHO add an unnecessary delay so it is
more efficient and more appropriate to wait before the actual kfree()
which is the operation that needs to wait for RCU grace period.

No, it is a bugreport from our customer. And even that customer
encountered it only once so far. Which is not very surprising as to
reproduce it, you have to be (un)lucky twice: first to have someone
overwrite the area soon enough and second to have someone access the
area after it is overwritten. This is IMHO the reason why the reporter
cleared the block with memset() for testing purposes.
