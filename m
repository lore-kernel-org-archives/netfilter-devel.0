How do you know? Did you measure it somehow? 

Normally I would expect fire wall state to mostly fit 
into caches (1MB+) of modern Opterons and other NUMA systems.

Normal vmalloc is NUMA aware and allocates on the local node.
Like all memory allocations

BTW if you want to put data onto a specific node you don't need
to schedule there - it is enough to set the process mempolicy
with sys_set_mempolicy. This is fine from kernel too, as long
as you save/restore the old one (current->mempolicy)
