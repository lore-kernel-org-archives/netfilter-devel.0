Fine, I can understand that in the case of the connbytes/unaligned case.

Speaking more generally:
I know I've been the exact opposite with all the nfnetlink_* stuff.
But the problem is to a certain degree that bugs aren't discovered until
it's in some tree that a lot of people use...

I think our whole usual strategy 'put it in patch-o-matic and wait until
bugs have been shaken out' doesn't really work because there's too
little people actually using the code from there.

So for new development, I'm now more inclined to push things sooner to
you - even more for code that only adds new featurss. If you generally
dislike that, please let me know.

sure.  no problem. Will be sent soon.
