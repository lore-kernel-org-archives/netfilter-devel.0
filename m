Someone added a for_each_net_rcu.  But right now I am not at all certain
I trust an rcu variant not to miss something, in a weird corner case.
When missing something translates to an unprivileged user triggerable
kernel oops I am not ready to play games.

As for the lock analysis.  Except for nf_tables nf_unregister_hook is
called by module removal routines where rtnl_lock() is safe.

With nftables we seem to do everything under some version of the
nfnl_lock.  Does the nfnl_lock have any problems with taking the
rtnl_lock to nest underneath it?

I tested this path and I did not have any practical problems, but I
don't think I had lockdep enabled at the time.
