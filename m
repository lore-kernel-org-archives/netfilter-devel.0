Ah, there it is, thanks for finding a specific instance.  I'd looked
a bit yesterday but couldn't find it.

Tetsuo, would you mind sending a patch to add a note to security.h's
comment for socket_sock_rcv_skb: that it can't sleep?  It also used
to be the case for security_task_free() which presumably would be
hooked by the ssyscall or whatever was mentioned.

thanks,
