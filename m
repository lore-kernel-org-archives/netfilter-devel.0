It seems very likely, any split-TCPish approach that tries to hide some 
losses that would happen on access links could cause this though it's 
very stupid to put such box there when there's a physical wire rather than 
wireless. And even with wireless the given configuration is not going to 
help but make things worse :-), the box is plain stupid as is (I guess 
it's deployed because some marketting guy has convinced some clueless 
whoever that they need the box :-)).

In theory it could be at the receiver below the TCP layer too but that's 
quite unlikely that smtp server would run on such stack. And also then 
it's kind of middlebox as TCP works end-to-end (not end host to end host)
while the rest remains as black box to it, even if something is performed 
on the very same host below TCP layer.

Even less likely thing is that TCP receiver would do this and it doesn't 
explain pacing of ACKs at all. ...It would be at least kind of twisting
of specs if not out-of-spec somewhere.

Sure, but that requires some thought still, I'll try after weekend so
that I can think it a bit more because there are plenty of states where
we can end to after the detection of the first RTO as spurious.

It might even be interesting to run CA_Recovery on RTOs when we detect 
this kind of middlebox because RTOs basically happen because there's lack 
of duplicate ACKs and then we could efficiently use partial ACKs to send 
just the lost segments rather than everything which is causing problems 
after the recovery has finished because we sent with too high rate while 
recovering. Then fallbackto CA_Loss if RTO is triggered again in 
CA_Recovery. But I'm not sure if it's worth of the effort though.

Probably yes, but I need to add some state. I could probably also make it 
to switch per flow to more robust approach on-demand when enough evidence 
is gathered. ...I think I'll add 1-bit history counter per flow so that 
it's possible to do print the warning and switch when there's third RTO in 
a single window (while two first were found spurious). IMHO it's unlikely 
enough that there will be three latency spikes (each longer than the 
previous) within a single window to make the decision, I wouldn't trust 
two enough because hand-overs can take time and have non-trivial effects.
