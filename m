So this is a change from existing.

In my case we can't control the number of namespaces, each user will get one as 
a virtual router is created.  We could change how we size things, but that 
doesn't stop one user from consuming larger than their 1/N share of entries. 
Typically we just increase the number of systems hosting these "routers" when we 
hit a limit, which decreases the netns count per node.

Creating a per-netns maximum seems doable, but maybe not practical from the 
accounting side of things.  Can't think of anything else at the moment.
