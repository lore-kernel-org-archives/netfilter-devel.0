Future extention idea: Perhaps we could auto detect the options the server 
supports, after the first connection have been created?
I know this is problematic/difficult for the iptables framework, because 
it would require the module to keep an internal dynamic state, which 
iptables module does not handle well (due to how the entires ruleset is 
reloaded on rule changes).
Guess, the easiest thing to implement, would be to give a warning,
if the options (the server supports) does not match the modules config.

It was a Xeon L5630 ;-)

We tested both SYN and ACK flood-attacks, while running ab (Apache 
Benchmark). The 1.4Mpps comes from limitations on the generator host 
(which used trafgen).  We also did some short tests with a modified 
pktgen.  And Martin wrote a test tool, that would delay conn 
establishment, to test retransmits.  And Patritck tested in (simulated) 
drop situations.

Yes, Martin and Patrick (and I) have done some good testing of the module. 
And we have flushed out and solved several bugs in this process.
