The walker is unlikely to see items that get inserted early in the hash
table even without a resize.

I'd be more worried about the walker missing big blocks of entries or
getting duplicate entries during a resize.
This might be a problem if the walker is a user-process table dump,
in which case you can't assume it will finish in any finite time.
