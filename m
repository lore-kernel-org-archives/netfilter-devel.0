I don't know what Patrick told you, but I think as a general rule of
thumb, all netfilter-related patches should go to netfilter-devel first.
Patrick or I will then push them upstream to DaveM (most times with Cc
to netdev).

For urgent/critical bugfixes (that are not too complex), I am ok if
netfilter-devel is bypassed and you submit it to netdev/davem
immediately.

Pragmatically speaking, Patrick or me will read your emails on either
list - but a number of other netfilter developers is not following
netdev, so you deprive them of the chance to give comments before it is
submitted ;)

Thanks!
