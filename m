Well, even if you didnt touch tc and got rid of the lock
it will still be about a magnitude faster than netfilter ;->
How about i call netfilter crap Patrick? It is slower than
molasses. For more than 10+ years no-one has found good ways
to bring it up to speed.

For sure the attempt to re-use netfilter code from tc has failed.
I think thats what you keep probably repeating as something that will
crash. Apart from some help from Pablo in recent times - this re-use
has been a disaster even when linking in user space (from lack of
backward incompatibilities mostly).
It seems to me we may just have to drop support for ipt and anything
netfilter from tc.
And at some point we are going to need those features, we'll just need
to write faster versions of them. ebpf maybe helpful.

What abstraction is broken? The ingress expects L3 headers. The egress
expects L2 headers. I dont think there is disagreement that the ingress
should see L2 headers. The view is that it will be a bit of work.
Discussion is ongoing to resolve this without penalizing performance.
You dont care about performance - netfilter is all about how to have
nice usability. I care about usability but not as much as i do
about performance.

And i strongly disagree. Netfilter is slow as a boring hot day.
Please dont enforce it on us. I thought you were kidding when you said
you want to move the ingress back to netfilter. We run away from there
years ago.
