Jan, while you're right I think the point of the aim of the example is
to show you that you only need to set the IP_TRANSPARENT flag before
being able to bind to a non-local address.

I'm not opposed to the changes, though, so could you please send a patc=
h
on top of Dave's current net-next tree? Thanks.

This is true only if you have connection tracking loaded while the new
tproxy can be used without conntrack.
