OK Antoine.

Yes, 'struct timeval' is as you discovered, ie relative to *something*,=
=20
a given event in the past. (in your case, CLOCK_REALTIME Epoch : Januar=
y=20
1th 1970)

It is even documented (man gettimeofday)

DESCRIPTION
       The  gettimeofday() function shall obtain the current time,=20
expressed as seconds and microseconds since the Epoch, and store it in =
the
       timeval structure pointed to by tp.

=46or timespec STAMPNS, see clock_gettime() description.

clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &ts);

If in your driver you stick in tstamp.tv64 a value like 0x00010002, the=
n=20
the result of ioctl(SIOCGSTAMP) will be :
tv.tv_sec =3D 0   (so yes, January 1th 1970)
tv.tv_usec =3D 65   (because 0x10002/1000 =3D 65)

Not counting the fact that .tv64 should not be directly set, unless for=
=20
0 value, because it is not portable.
