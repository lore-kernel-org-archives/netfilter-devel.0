Sure, its a cloned packet - from a billing perspective we can look at it
as a different flow. Contrack bills, qdisc unbills.
What i meant is packet still flowing within the qdisc infrastructure.
what i drew as:
   ..-->classification --> tcaction
return code1 --> enqueue
return code2 ...(packet may be freed here)--> dev.c

Thats the only place i see skb->unbilled as useful.

So:
all components need to increment their won proivate stats and should
call stats_incr() but only the first one gets to unbill;
eg if action calls stats_incr to indicate drop; you unbill. When
qdisc enqueue calls stats_incr with a drop reason, you dont want to
unbill again.

We could talk in more details about code after - just discussing
concepts right now.

cheers,
jamal
