Hi,

How should I proceed to get any response in this matter? Should I be 
contacting someone else? I'm no authority on IPv6, so I would like an 
informed opinion...
Mapping the IPv6 hooks onto the bridge hooks was really easy, because there is 
no NAT stuff to mess things up. This is not a complicated patch. Also, if the 
bridge-nf code causes a malfunction in ip6tables, this can be undone by 
simply setting /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-ip6tables 0 untill a 
solution is available.

cheers,
Bart
