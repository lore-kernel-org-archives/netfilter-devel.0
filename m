After bisecting for hours, l only had ten revisions left to test.
There was this commit that caught my eye:

------------------------------
commit c96fd3d461fa495400df24be3b3b66f0e0b152f9
Author: Ilpo J=E4rvinen <ilpo.jarvinen@helsinki.fi>

    [TCP]: Enable SACK enhanced FRTO (RFC4138) by default
------------------------------

This change sets the value of "tcp_frto" to 2 by default.
If I reset it to zero, the connection works immediately.
@D=E2niel Fraga: Does disabling tcp_frto work for you, too?

Disabling tcp_sack makes no difference. To summarize the situation,
I had two different cases of stalling TCP connections, both connecting
to busy SMTP relays servers which probably drop some packets here and t=
here.

I can easily reproduce the problem, so how do we go from here?

Cheers,
Thomas
