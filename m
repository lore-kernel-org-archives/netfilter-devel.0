That's the old module name, but yes, it is very useful in desktops and
laptops (when it works).   Server-class hardware will have a baseboard
management unit that can really power-cycle the system instead of just
rebooting.

And test it first before you depend on it triggering at a remote location,
as the firmware might cause the Intel chipset watchdog to actually hang the
box instead of causing a proper reboot (happens on the IBM thinkpad T43, for
example).
