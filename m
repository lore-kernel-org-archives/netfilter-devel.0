Though, in this case, the priv_flags are not in any way visible to
user-space, so it would be quite hard to find a use for them!

So should we also expose struct net_device_stats again?  During the
introduction to 64-bit stats I changed and un-exported the definition,
then later had to revert the definition but left it un-exported.  This
broke compilation of iproute2, though in the process it revealed an
existing bug: <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.network/169764>.
