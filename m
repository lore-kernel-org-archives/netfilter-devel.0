In this patch, conn->addr is used to save the destination/source
address instead of conn->tuple.src.u3, so the conn->tuple is used for
conntrack lookup only. Just as the original tuple isn't updated, we
can use it to looking up the associated conntrack all the time.

addr: 192.168.0.1
tuple: src =3D home, dst =3D router
