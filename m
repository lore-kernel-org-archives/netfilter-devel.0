indeed, I already move to the encoding of values independantly within
netlink attributes. This had to be done before, and it was in the
TODO, so now it's done. 

At first, I tried to use a attribute NLA_BINARY with all the datas
inside snet_sock_info, so it won't break the netlink protocol between
userspace and kernel, at each modification (adding/removing element
inside the structure)
