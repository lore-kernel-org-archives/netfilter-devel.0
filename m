Agreed; ideally, the initial table size would just use a single page for
the array of bucket heads, which would give 1024 buckets on 32-bit
systems or 512 on 64-bit systems.  That's more than enough for many
client systems, and for many single-application network namespaces.

Quite feasible.  Actually, any integer multiple works fine, though I
think a power of two makes sense.  I'd suggest trying 4x with the same
workloads that had an issue at 2x, and seeing how that goes.
