I have tested the patch on 2.6.35.  Which implies I also needed to
cherry-pick 870f67dcf7ef, which implements the vzalloc() call. (Latest
net-next has a problem with my HP CCISS driver/controller or the PCI
layout, and will not boot)

According to the function_graph trace, the execution time of
get_counters() has increased (approx) from 109 ms to 120 ms, which is
the expected result.

The results are not all positive, but I think its related to the
debugging options I have enabled.

Because I now see packet drops if my 1Gbit/s pktgen script are sending
packet with a packet size below 512 bytes, which is "only" approx 230
kpps (this is 1Gbit/s on my 10G labsetup where I have seen 5 Mpps).

There is no packet overruns/drops, iif I run "iptables -vnL >
/dev/null" without tracing enabled and only 1Gbit/s pktgen at 512
bytes packets.  If I enable tracing while calling iptables I see
packet drops/overruns.  So I guess this is caused by the tracing
overhead.

I'll try to rerun my test without all the lock debugging options
enabled.
