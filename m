Agreed - looks like your fix should work.  However, two nits:

1) normally RCU functions have _rcu suffixes.  So nf_ct_ext_free should
become nf_ct_ext_free_rcu.

2) kfree_rcu was not added to the kernel until 3.0.  All of the bug
reports I've been looking into (including the original in netfilter bugzilla
at http://bugzilla.netfilter.org/show_bug.cgi?id=714) have been reported in
2.6.32 or earlier kernels.  So a different fix would need to be backported for
-stable.  For that, we would probably export __nf_ct_ext_free_rcu from
nf_conntrack_extend.c and change the kfree call in nf_ct_ext_free_rcu to
call_rcu(&ct->ext->rcu, __nf_ct_ext_free_rcu). Of course the alternative
is just to use this fix for both old and new kernels for simplicity.

Yes, hitting this seems dependent upon phase of the moon.
