No need to be sorry :) The use cases only partially overlap, the zero copy
(actually single copy, just like mmaped netlink) requires drivers to generate
fragmented skbs, while the mmaped netlink code works in all cases. It also
supports TX and, in case of nfnetlink_queue, modification of the packets.
And it works for all netlink subsystems and is not specific to nfnetlink_queue.

So I think while the nfnetlink_queue zero copy patches are a great idea,
there are still enough unhandled use cases for memory mapped netlink.

Hmm that might actually also be a problem in the zcopy case for userspace since
the netlink recv buffer sizes are in many cases not that large.
