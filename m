As long as it accepts relative paths, I think it will always work.
Worst case, a user has to cd. No need for hardcoding the bpf mount
point at compile time.

I have the matching iptables patch for pinned objects, btw. Not for
elf objects, which requires linking to libelf and parsing the object,
which is more work (and perhaps best punted on by expanding libbpf in
bcc to include this functionality. it already exists under samples/bpf
and iproute2).
