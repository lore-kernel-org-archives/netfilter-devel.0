I hammered it a couple nights ago. First test was 5000 processes on 6 SMP CPUs opening and closing a port on a 'remote' host using the usual random source ports. Only got up to 32000 conntracks. The generator was a 64-bit Smoothwall KVM without the patch. The traffic passed through a 32-bit Smoothwall KVM with the patch. The target was on the VM host. No problems encountered. I suspect I didn't come close to triggering the original problem. Second test was a couple thousand processes all using the same source IP and port and dest IP and port. Still no problems. But these were perl scripts (and they used lots of RAM); perhaps a short C program would let me run more.

Any ideas on how I might test it more brutally?
