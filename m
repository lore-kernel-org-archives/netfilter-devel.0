Sure, we can do that.  But why is a fixed size better than a fraction?

E.g. with 8k buckets and simple goal = GC_MAX_BUCKETS we scan entire
table on every run, currently we only scan 128.

I wanted to keep too many destroy notifications from firing at once
but maybe i was too paranoid...

Agree, but that depends on what 'reasonable' means and what kind of
uneeded cpu churn we're willing to add.

We can add a sysctl for this but we should use a low default to not do
too much unneeded work.

So what about your original patch, but only add

nf_conntrack_gc_interval

(and also add instant-resched in case entire budget was consumed)?
