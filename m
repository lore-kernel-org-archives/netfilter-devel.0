The corresponding OVS userspace patches contain the new test cases for =
the NAT features (http://openvswitch.org/pipermail/dev/2015-November/06=
1920.html) in tests/system-traffic.at. I=E2=80=99ll walk through two of=
 them below.

Test case: conntrack - simple SNAT

In these tests ports 1 and 2 are in different namespaces. The flow tabl=
e below allows all IPv4 traffic between port 1 to port 2, but IP connec=
tions from port 1 to port 2 are source NATted:

    in_port=3D1,ip,action=3Dct(commit,zone=3D1,nat(src=3D10.1.1.240-10.=
1.1.255)),2
    in_port=3D2,ct_state=3D-trk,ip,action=3Dct(table=3D0,zone=3D1,nat)
    in_port=3D2,ct_state=3D+trk,ct_zone=3D1,ip,action=3D1

This flow table matches all IPv4 traffic from port 1, runs them through=
 conntrack in zone 1 and NATs them. The NAT is initialized to do source=
 IP mapping to the given range for the first packet of each connection,=
 after which the new connection is committed. For further packets of al=
ready tracked connections NAT is done according to the connection state=
 and the commit is a no-op. Each packet that is not flagged as a drop b=
y the CT action is forwarded to port 2. The CT action does an implicit =
fragmentation reassembly, so that only complete packets are run through=
 conntrack. Reassembled packets are re-fragmented on output.

The IPv4 traffic coming from port 2 is first matched for the non-tracke=
d state (-trk), which means that the packet has not been through a CT a=
ction yet. Such traffic is run trough the conntrack in zone 1 and all p=
ackets associated with a NATted connection are NATted also in the retur=
n direction. After the packet has been through conntrack it is recircul=
ated back to table 0 (which is the default table, so all the rules abov=
e are in table 0). The CT action changes the =E2=80=98trk=E2=80=99 flag=
 to being set, so the packets after recirculation match the third rule =
(+trk), and the packet is output on port 1. Since also the ct_zone is m=
atched, only packets that were actually tracked by conntrack can match =
the 3rd rule and output to 1.

I=E2=80=99m skipped the rules for ARP handling in this walkthrough, but=
 the test case has rules to match on the ARP request on the NATted addr=
ess and reply to it.

The above is verified with a HTTP request and a subsequent conntrack en=
try listing in the test case:

    dnl HTTP requests from p0->p1 should work fine.
    NETNS_DAEMONIZE([at_ns1], [[$PYTHON $srcdir/test-l7.py]], [http0.pi=
d])
    NS_CHECK_EXEC([at_ns0], [wget 10.1.1.2 -t 5 -T 1 --retry-connrefuse=
d -v -o wget0.log])

    AT_CHECK([conntrack -L 2>&1 | FORMAT_CT(10.1.1.2) | sed -e 's/dst=3D=
10.1.1.2[[45]][[0-9]]/dst=3D10.1.1.2XX/'], [0], [dnl
    TIME_WAIT src=3D10.1.1.1 dst=3D10.1.1.2 sport=3D<cleared> dport=3D<=
cleared> src=3D10.1.1.2 dst=3D10.1.1.2XX sport=3D<cleared> dport=3D<cle=
ared> [[ASSURED]] mark=3D0 zone=3D1 use=3D1
    ])


As a second example, I=E2=80=99ll walk through a test case of NAT with =
=46TP on IPv6:

As before, ports 1 (p0) and 2 (p1) reside in different namespaces (=E2=80=
=98at_ns0=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98at_ns1=E2=80=99, respectively). A stati=
c neighbor cache entry for the NATted address is created in at_ns1. In =
a more realistic scenario a controller would need to implement a ND pro=
xy instead:

    ADD_VETH(p0, at_ns0, br0, "fc00::1/96")
    NS_CHECK_EXEC([at_ns0], [ip link set dev p0 address 80:88:88:88:88:=
88])
    ADD_VETH(p1, at_ns1, br0, "fc00::2/96")
    dnl Would be nice if NAT could translate neighbor discovery message=
s, too.
    NS_CHECK_EXEC([at_ns1], [ip -6 neigh add fc00::240 lladdr 80:88:88:=
88:88:88 dev p1])


The OpenFlow rules are split into two tables (table 0 and table 1).

Table 0 tracks all IPv6 traffic and drops all other traffic. Packets ar=
e recirculated to table 1 after conntrack. Existing connections are NAT=
ted before recirculation:

    table=3D0 priority=3D10 ip6, action=3Dct(nat,table=3D1)
    table=3D0 priority=3D0 action=3Ddrop

Table 1:

=46TP control connections from the =E2=80=9Cprivate=E2=80=9D address to=
 port 21 are output to port 1 after being tracked, NATted, and committe=
d (=3D=3D confirmed).

    table=3D1 in_port=3D1 ct_state=3D+new tcp6 ipv6_src=3Dfc00::1 tp_ds=
t=3D21  action=3Dct(alg=3Dftp,commit,nat(src=3Dfc00::240)),2

The matches on the source/dest IP address below are not really needed, =
but in the test case they are to make sure the NATting actually happens=
=2E

Related TCP connections to the reverse direction are NATted, committed =
and output to port 1:

    table=3D1 in_port=3D2 ct_state=3D+new+rel tcp6 ipv6_dst=3Dfc00::240=
 action=3Dct(commit,nat),1

Packets on established TCP connections are allowed both ways (the CT ac=
tion in table 0 NATted these before recirculation, so we see the mapped=
 address going from port 1 to port 2, and the reverse-mapped (=3D=3D or=
iginal) address on return traffic):

    table=3D1 in_port=3D1 ct_state=3D+est tcp6 ipv6_src=3Dfc00::240   a=
ction=3D2
    table=3D1 in_port=3D2 ct_state=3D+est tcp6 ipv6_dst=3Dfc00::1     a=
ction=3D1=20

We pass icmp6 packets both ways:

    table=3D1 priority=3D100 in_port=3D1 icmp6, action=3D2
    table=3D1 priority=3D100 in_port=3D2 icmp6, action=3D1

Everything else is dropped:

    table=3D1 priority=3D0, action=3Ddrop

=46unctionality is verified with a Python FTP server in at_ns1 and wget=
 to it from at_ns0:

    NETNS_DAEMONIZE([at_ns1], [[$PYTHON $srcdir/test-l7.py ftp]], [ftp0=
=2Epid])

    dnl FTP requests from p0->p1 should work fine.
    NS_CHECK_EXEC([at_ns0], [wget=20
ftp://[[fc00::2
]] -6 --no-passive-ftp -t 3 -T 1 --retry-connrefused -v --server-respon=
se --no-proxy --no-remove-listing -o wget0.log -d])

Both the control connection and the data connection were NATted:

    AT_CHECK([conntrack -L -f ipv6 2>&1 | FORMAT_CT(fc00::2) | grep -v =
"FIN" | grep -v "CLOSE"], [0], [dnl
    TIME_WAIT src=3Dfc00::1 dst=3Dfc00::2 sport=3D<cleared> dport=3D<cl=
eared> src=3Dfc00::2 dst=3Dfc00::240 sport=3D<cleared> dport=3D<cleared=
> [[ASSURED]] mark=3D0 helper=3Dftp use=3D2
    TIME_WAIT src=3Dfc00::2 dst=3Dfc00::240 sport=3D<cleared> dport=3D<=
cleared> src=3Dfc00::1 dst=3Dfc00::2 sport=3D<cleared> dport=3D<cleared=
> [[ASSURED]] mark=3D0 use=3D1
    ])

The flow tables in the test cases are OpenFlow tables, which are transl=
ated to kernel flows by ovs-vswitchd. I have included the relevant kern=
el datapath flows generated in the IPv6 NAT test case above below for y=
our reference. Please note that the kernel port numbers are different f=
rom the OpenFlow port numbers, as each bridge has it=E2=80=99s own rang=
e of OpenFlow port numbers, but they all share the same kernel datapath=
=2E In this case OpenFlow port 1 is kernel port 2, and OpenFlow port 2 =
is kernel port 3. Kernel flows are all in the same table and they have =
no priorities (so they should have mutually exclusive matches). Recircu=
lation IDs are allocated on-demand, here the recirculation ID 1 deals w=
ith traffic to the original direction and 2 to the return direction (re=
circ_id(0) designates no recirculation). ovs_vswitchd always exact matc=
hes IP frag, so since the test traffic had no fragments, you=E2=80=99ll=
 see (frag=3Dno) in each flow below. Also, the packet that causes the f=
low to be created is executed independently (but with the same actions)=
 of the newly created flow, so the kernel datapath flow counts do not r=
eflect the first packet (OpenFlow counters do), this explains 0 counts =
on some flows below:

The generated matches depend on the order of processing of rules in the=
 OpenFlow tables, which can be influenced by specifying rule priorities=
 to OpenFlow rules. For example, with a different set of priorities the=
 datapath rules become (In this test run the first IP (ICMPv6) packet w=
as received from at_ns1, so the recirc_ids are reversed from above, ICM=
Pv6 flows not included here.):
