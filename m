All the parts from filter.c which is BPF's core engine have been moved
into kernel/bpf/ to get it ready for tracing et al, since there is not
always a socket context anymore. The *whole* infrastructure around struct
sk_filter is [e]BPF and used in non-net related contexts as well, whereas
nft socket filtering is *only* for sockets. Due to the socket-only specific
use case why doesn't it make more sense to have a union in struct sock
around sk_filter (or however we name it) and only allow one of the two
being loaded on a socket?
