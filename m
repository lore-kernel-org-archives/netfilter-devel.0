It may not be obvious, but subject already raised on this list, so I'll
try to be as precise as possible (But may be wrong on some points, I'll
let Patrick correct me if necessary)

ipt_do_table() is not a readonly function returning a verdict.

1) It handles a stack (check how is used next->comefrom) that seems to
be stored on rules themselves. (This is how I understand this code)
This is safe as each cpu has its own copy of rules/counters, and BH pro=
tected.

2) It also updates two 64 bit counters (bytes/packets) on each matched =
rule.

3) Some netfilter matches/targets probably rely on the fact their handl=
ers
are run with BH disabled by their caller (ipt_do_table()/arp/ip6...)

These must be BH protected (and preempt disabled too), or else :

1) A softirq could interrupt a process in the middle of ipt_do_table()
and corrupt its "stack".

2) A softirq could interrupt a process in ipt_do_table() in the middle
 of the ADD_COUNTER(). Some counters could be corrupted.

3) Some netfiler extensions would break.

Previous linux versions already used a read_lock_bh() here, on a single
and shared rwlock, there is nothing new on this BH locking AFAIK.

Thank you
