Cool, thanks.

It seems that there are lots of possibilities to get this to work, but
this is starting to get quite complex.  I would still prefer having the
NFNOTIF module included, since we would be able to do what we want in a
very simple way.  It's also probably much more efficient that using
several rules, which would increase the CPU usage considerably (in our
device we are already reaching the limit of a reasonable CPU resource
usage with high throughput WLAN connections).

While I agree that it is possible to achieve the NFNOTIF functionality
with existing modules, I still think there is a "niche" for such module,
because it is very simple, has a very clear purpose and would make the
ruleset simpler and more efficient.

Does this make any sense?
