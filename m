What happens is the conntrack code attempts to free
nf_conntrack_untracked back into the SL[U]B cache from which it
allocates other ct's. There's just one problem...that's a static struct
not from the cache. So, this is why we end up with the SLAB being
corrupted and the address immediately following the
nf_conntrack_untracked being corrupted.

I shoved some debug comments into the destroy code to see if we were
trying to free nf_conntrack_untracked, and bingo. I have shoved a panic
in there now, will send you a backtrace.

Jon.
