The exact message is not that big deal :-).

Ok. Though this all opens more questions than answers... :-(, why isn't 
there any traffic in neither of the tcpdumps then (not in the client's
nor in the server's).

I guess it might have something to do with the additional 3-way 
handshake that gets attempted but who knows...

I don't think it was bad at all... :-) I just meant that there wasn't any 
other visible traffic, which is very very strange because nothing port 995 
related (or anything else) seems to happen during the nmap... Which 
network interfaces the server has? Could things get routed through some 
other iface during the time of trouble (and during the nmap solution), 
that would explain why it isn't visible in the tcpdump which is for the 
specific interface.

Ah, ok.
