Check and fix the configuration. The reason why I left at least some
kind of warning is that the module does something that is unexpected as
the checksum is not calculated (this module is often used in
virtualization environments where "hardware checksum offload" in fact
means the checksum is not computed at all).

But maybe it would suffice to add a note in iptables-extensions(8) man
page explicitely saying that it doesn't work with GSO packets (and is of
questionable usefulness for TCP in general).
