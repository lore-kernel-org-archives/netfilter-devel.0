The idea makes sense ..

I'm not sure this is correct, I think it will only allow communication
with truely on-link addresses, meaning it won't accept routed packets
going to the interface address. Generally I don't think this can be
fully done in iptables since you'd still have to deal with ARP etc.
An IPv4 sysctl might be more appropriate.

Just for the IPv4 packets, I'm wondering if the intended result could
be achieved using the addrtype match. Something like:

-m addrtype --limit-iface-in --dst-type LOCAL

should check whether the destination address is local to the receiving
interface.
