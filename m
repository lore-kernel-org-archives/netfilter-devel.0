I've moved those prototypes. But the move involves moving of two header files:
ip_conntrack_helper_h323_asn1.h and ip_conntrack_helper_h323_types.h.
This is because ip_conntrack_h323.h now has to include
ip_conntrack_helper_h323_asn1.h and thus ip_conntrack_helper_h323_types.h,
so they are moved from net/ipv4/netfilter/ to include/linux/netfilter_ipv4/ to
make sure other header files like ip_conntrack_h323.h and ip_conntrack.h
be able to find them.

Is this ok or you have a better idea?

Thanks a lot!
