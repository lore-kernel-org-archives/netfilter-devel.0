One more reason to factor out this code into general locking code.

The latest code looks a bit similar to the old big-reader-locks hack 
(which got dropped for good many eons ago and with which i deny any 
involvement with, such as having authored it. [oh, did i say that 
out loud? crap.]), implemented cleanly and properly.

IMHO this locking construct should be considered for 
linux/local_lock.h and kernel/local_lock.c. Even if the netfilter 
code drops its use soon afterwards ;-)

[ The _only_ thing i am worried about is the apparent fact that
  there's so much confusion about recursion versus read-access.
  Recursion might be hard to factor out of the netfilter code, and
  maybe it's not even possible realistically (we fought years with
  the BKL and are still fighting it) but if its harms are not even
  _realized_ that difficult task turns into an impossible task ;-) ]
