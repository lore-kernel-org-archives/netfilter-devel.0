Perhaps it's possible to call ip_options_compile with a skb == NULL, 
like ip_options.c::ip_options_get_finish does. That way we don't need to 
duplicate code.
An alternative would be to make sure that the data pointed to by IPCB 
and BR_INPUT_SKB_CB don't overlap. If this were the case, we could 
indeed just revert the commit that was referred to.


cheers,
Bart
