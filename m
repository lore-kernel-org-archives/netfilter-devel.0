I'm refering to this specifically:

static int function(int parameter1, struct another_structure *blah,
                    int parameter2, unsigned int parameter3);
                    ^

It is just a comestic issue, but we consistently align function
parameters to the initial parens.

As I said, I have just manually fixed this here, so no problem, just
keep this in mind for the next time.

Another observation: You should bump patch version numbering in each
revision and keep some history on its evolution.

The area after the patch separator --- and before diff stats is good
to place volatile information that is only meaningful to the review
process, I mean something like this:

  subsystem: Patch title.

  Patch description...

  Signed-off-by: Lucas Skywalker <trotacielos@blackstar.org>
  ---
  v3: Address comments from Chebakia on possible backward compatibility
      issues.
  v2: New parameter to control something.
  v1: Initial patch.

  include/net/netfilter/nf_tables.h |  25 ++-

Thanks.
