Agreed. If you grow from 4 to cover 1M entries you need countless
growth cycles and you end up creating huge chains which will make the
ongoing expands take even longer.

I think we need to implement Herbert's suggestion and have inserts
fail if a certain upper watermark is reached.

I'm also investigating if we can grow by n*2 instead of just *2.
