The original bug report comes from simply bootup:

  "I'm loading all the firewall rules during boot-up and this 6 secs 
   slowness is really not very nice to wait for."

IOW, the problematic case likely effectively has _nothing_ else going on. 
Sure, there might be some parallelism (the bootup scripts are getting 
better for that), but hopefully not 6 seconds worth, and not likely any 
complex critical sections.
