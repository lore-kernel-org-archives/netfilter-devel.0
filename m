When testing, I always run into the "kernel: sky2 lan0: rx error,
status 0x977d977d length 0" problem before anything else.

I need to eliminate the sky2 driver from the equation before I'm able
to prove if there is a problem elsewhere or not. I did have some e1000
NICs, but not any longer, so it'll have to wait until I can find a
stable scenario for my sky2 NIC...
