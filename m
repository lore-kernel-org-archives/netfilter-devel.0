I support this change and I also don't think it makes sense
to have a jhash3.h new header file, that's just a waste of
time.  Either the new stuff is better or it isn't, and that
whole "matching hashes" argument is pure garbage.

But this kind of change isn't for me to decide, changing jhash
impacts the entire tree not just networking, and also I know
that Rusty Russell was investigating making this change and
he even did his own timings on various platforms.

Therefore this needs to be proposed on linux-kernel with appropriate
parties CC:'d.

Thanks.
