It would really have been helpful over the weekend to have just been
able to look around in sysfs to see what was going on with namespaces.
I'm not saying it can't be done in a debugger, or by poking at
backtraces, but it's easier to say to the many people who had this
problem in Fedora kernels "tell me what this file says" just like we do
for slab, memory, whatever other information. Just a suggestion.

Just an ability to walk through which namespaces exist (debugfs even)
and which resources are currently assigned to them. Somehow. I didn't
give it a lot of thought, but something would be useful.
