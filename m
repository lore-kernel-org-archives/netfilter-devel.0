In particular the default /proc permissions say you have to be the owner
of the process (or root) to access the file.  If you are the owner of
the process with a namespace (or root) you already have permission to
access and manipulate the namespace.

Additionally setns like unshare requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN (aka root magic).

Simply keeping the process running, pins the namespace. That requires no
new permissions.

Similarly socketat.  It is possible to use unix domain sockets to
implement it today without any kernel changes.  It is just an
unnecessary pain to run a server process to pin a namespace or to serve
up file descriptors in other network namespaces.

The primary change of this patchset is the ability to do everything
with file descriptors, and with the mount namespace.  That moves
everything from a bizarre hard to understand and manipulate interface
to one where things can be done much more easily, and cheaply.
Resulting in a much more powerful and usable interface.
