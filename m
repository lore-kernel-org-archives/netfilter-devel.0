Re-reading this, I am not sure there is a real problem on RCU as you
pointed out.

With 800.000 entries, in a 300.032 buckets hash table, each lookup hit
about 3 entries (aka searches in conntrack stats)

300.000 packets/second -> 900.000 'searches' per second.

If you have four cpus all trying to insert/delete entries in //, they
all hit the central conntrack lock.

On a DDOS scenario, every packet needs to take this lock twice,
once to free an old conntrack (early drop), once to insert a new entry.

To scale this, only way would be to have an array of locks, like we hav=
e
for TCP/UDP hash tables.

I did some tests here, with a multiqueue card, flooded with 300.000
pack/second, 65.536 source IP, millions of flows, and nothing wrong
happened (but packets drops, of course)

My two cpus were busy 100%, after tweaking smp_affinities, because on
first try, irqbalance put "01" mask on both queues, so only one ksoftir=
q
was working, other cpu was idle :(
