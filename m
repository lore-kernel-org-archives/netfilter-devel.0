As the dumps are really big, I uploaded them to a temporary space.
Included are two tcpdumps of stalling connections using git "master".
The first one stalls around ~1.3mb, the second one around ~4mb.

Get it from here:
http://www.intra2net.com/de/download/tcpdump/tcp_frto_tcpdumps.tar.bz2

There is another box in front of my test system doing NAT
which is running 2.6.24.7. I've tested with and without tcp_frto
on that box to make sure it's not FRTO related.

I've also included a tcpdump with FRTO disabled, so you can see
the connection is actually working. Just by looking at the packet flow
while tracing the connection looks much smoother without FRTO
and doesn't stall for seconds here and there.

Cheers,
Thomas
