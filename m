No objection at all. I certainly understand the implications to
netns. After all this is the reason why rhashtable exists. However,
the initial tabe size plus number of growth cycles has some
implications on max number of bucket locks (see below). So it's
a matter of balance that needs some thought and experimentation.

There is a side effect. We can't grow the number of bucket locks more
than 2x if we grow the table itself faster than 2x. So if we start
out with a table size of 512 and grow 4 times in a row we will end
up with a theoretical max bucket locks of 4K. Probably enough though.
