It is quite possible that you are missing nothing, but the hope is
that by growing by larger factors, we reduce the lengths of the chains
in the new table, thus limiting the slowdown on subsequent resizes.

If worst comes to worst, of course, there are a couple of other
RCU protected resizable hash tables.
