Ok, confirmed working in tunnel mode, ping6 packet was counted twice in
different rules (esp and icmpv6)

But for outgoing ping6 packets, this won't work, packet is only counted
(and accepted) by the icmpv6 rule, esp rule got no match, also not the
"all" rule.

Looks like at the moment, outgoing packet is passing netfilter only one
time, even if encryption is in tunnel mode.

By design / bug / missing feature?
