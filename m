Yep, so far the netfilter code should be correct since my batch
of HW checksum fixes.

That may be the reason. I've audited most relevant code-paths
for this case and they seem to be mostly OK. There are a couple
of cases in the ppp code I'm not sure about yet, but I couldn't
trigger any errors in my test-setup. Anyway they don't seem to
be related to this problem since it also happens with sk98_lin
which doesn't set CHECKSUM_HW.

Yes, this is not handled so far. But is looks like there is
some other problem because it also happens with sk98_lin.

Thanks for your help Stephen.
