Actually we can never achieve perfect symmetry because the two cases
are fundamentally different.  On outbound we start with a template
which guides us all the way to the end.  On inbound we (currently)
don't determine the policy until the very end.

Having said that I'm certainly not averse to such a solution.  The
only thing I would like to see is for it to be flexible enough so
that you always get at least one chance to SNAT before the xfrm_policy
is completely pinned down.  This should leave the user with enough
flexibility to do whatever they wish.

Cheers,
