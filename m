No, it shouldn't be necessary, as there's no legacy installed base of 
rulesets (as there was with disk files), and MLS is now generally enabled 
by default.  Also, these rules are never exposed to general users, and 
even sysadmins should generate the rules via some kind of tool.

It would also add some complexity.
