Hi Stephen,

Thanks for your feedback.

No ebtables or VLAN used; the relevant part of iptables I have:

iptables -t filter -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -t filter -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 445 --syn -j ACCEPT # SMB
iptables -t filter -A INPUT -j DROP

This may be linked to the use of the large MTU (7500 or 9000) for the
sky2 linux box and the client was transmitting back to the sky2 with
an MTU of 1500.

This 'status 0x977d977d' message is received before the above problem
occurs and I couldn't reproduce the 'hw csum failure' last night. The
client is a Broadcom NetExtreme PCI-E card purportedly with flow
control on. I have got the reproducer down to:

1. use 2.6.17-rc4 w/ sky2 MTU patch
2. increase MTU to >= 7500
3. decrease MTU to 1500
4. send ~1-2GB out of sky2 NIC
5. "rx error, status 0x977d977d length 0" messages received

I have found that without raising the MTU initially to 7500/9000, this
problem does not occur. Perhaps chip tx buffers aren't shrunk when the
MTU is dropped?

Is there a tunable low-watermark for starting the DMA transfer from
the chip on rx? The client isn't sending back that much (TCP acks
every segment, SMB protocol acks every 64KB), but I guess there are
fewer rx buffers are available, as larger tx buffers are used on the
sky2 chip for the large tx packets.

Let me know if this is a scenario that isn't expected to work, or if
there is anything else I can look at or try.

Thanks again!
