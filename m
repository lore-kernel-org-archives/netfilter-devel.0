	Ok.

	Static setup. But there were traces of a multipath config I
used before and completely forgot (below).

	Yes, you can believe me. Anyway, I disabled the eth1 interface.
And there's more! We never had 2 links on this server, although I was
always prepared to use multipath and ip route policy (since the plans
were to have 2 links). I had 2 commands which I suspect maybe could be
messing everything:

#ip rule add from ${link0} lookup 1
#ip route add 0/0 via ${gw0} table 1

#ip rule add from ${link1} lookup 2
#ip route add 0/0 via ${gw1} table 2

	I deleted all of this. I just use this if I had to links from
two ISPs and decided to load balance between them. As it isn't the
case...

	Yes, in my client machine, I'm behind a D-Link 524 router.
Anyway, give me some days, I'll test with these new changes for a week
at least before confirming the problem was solved (and with both frto
and htb enabled).

	If it's really this old Mulitpath misconfiguration, I apologize
for my error and the length discussion. Anyway, it's good to register,
in the case someone do the same error as me.

	Well, let's wait to see if the problem has gone.

	Thank you very much.
