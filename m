I see, so we possibly see a lot of duplicates but we will never miss
any entries.

So in summary we do:

2) We allow rhashtable users to opt in to Herbert's consistent walker
   relying on the use of an additional bit.

2) If user supports NLM_F_DUMP_INTR we block out resizes during
   message construction and set NLM_F_DUMP_INTR if a resize/rehash
   interrupted us while the user read.

3) If (1) and (2) are not available we do (2) but restart the dump
   on interruption thus causing duplicates but never missing any
   entries.

I think this offers good flexibility for new users and compatibility
for existing users.
