I made a mistake and applied to net-2.6 a patch from Eric Dumazet that
only is applicable for net-next-2.6

I really don't want to have to toss Linus that commit and a revert commit
just to fix it up.

So I rewound the net-2.6 tree by 8 commits.

So if you've pulled in the past 3 hours, please reset your pull and repull.

Thanks!
