That is a most practical suggestion.

I'm not sure what you think is unsafe about using the filter table, and 
the order of evaluation issues certainly seem to suggest that some 
actions would take a major rethink at least. Perhaps you could avoid 
breaking all of the setups which currently work, rather than force 
everyone to do things differently because you feel that your way is better.
