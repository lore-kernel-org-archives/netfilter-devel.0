I didn't debug it further so I can't answer that question. But the problem was clearly in the cable modem. Power cycling the modem brought back connectivity, for a little while. I was able to muddle through this since I work with this stuff for a living, but if I had been an IP-unsavvy Joe Sixpack who was trying out a Linux live CD on his home PC as an alternative to Windows, I suspect I would have given up in disgust.

Something to think about for those of us who would like to see wider adoption of Linux on the PC desktop.
