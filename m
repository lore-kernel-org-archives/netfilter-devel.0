Hi,
You should fix your subject line to include the subsystem [1], something like
netfilter: ipset: fix...
The path to the file being patched is incorrect, patches should be generated in
the root kernel source dir [2].
Also it'd be nice to add a Fixes tag [3] to show which commit introduced the bug,
in this case it looks like it's:
Fixes: 00590fdd5be0 ("netfilter: ipset: Introduce RCU locking in list type")

Cheers,
 Nik
