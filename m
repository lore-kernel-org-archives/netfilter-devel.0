The ipt_REJECT target can send TCP RSTs with foreign source which
go through LOCAL_OUT. Restricting it to this case and adding proper
checks to ipt_REJECT would relieve us of having to handle the last
case you pointed out (foreign saddr, broadcast/multicast daddr), but
it shouldn't be hard to also handle this case.

These assumptions are only for stateful NAT, the mangle table seems
to try to deal with stateless NAT by rerouting in LOCAL_OUT when
saddr/daddr changed. But it could also just be some left-over
cut-n-pasted from ip_nat_standalone.c, I don't think anyone is doing
stateless NAT with netfilter.
