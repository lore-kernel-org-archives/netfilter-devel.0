The binary should call bpf_obj_get on the filepath each time. These are
not regular files, but references to a pinned object in the bpf filesystem.

Blindly passing back the fd received from the kernel is clearly wrong. I'm
really surprised that I did not run into this problem when I wrote the
feature.

Because these are pinned objects in the bpf filesystem, and there is
only one of those, it may be possible to lookup the object in the kernel
without relying on a process-local view of mount points.
