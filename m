[ I have been waiting for more than a week for a netns developer
  to review this patch, I guess I'm too optimistic these days. :-( ]

The only reason you think __exit_refok is "bogus" is because it's
semantics got changed by Sam Ravnborg in commit
312b1485fb509c9bc32eda28ad29537896658cb8 ("Introduce new section
reference annotations tags: __ref, __refdata, __refconst")

Beforehand the __exit_refok was a real .exit section, so it got
completely discarded AT LINK TIME.  Now it sits together with
__init_refok which is an unremovable kernel image section, which
neither gets removed at compile time nor boot time.

So __exit_refok did exactly what you say it should do before Sam's
change.

It's just completely stupid to change the netns section defines,
and instead we should revert __exit_refok to mean what it always
meant previously.

I'm not applying this patch.
