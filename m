Some thoughts, nothing very earth-shattering yet...

It seems that the server (port 995) never leaves SYN-RECV state because it 
keeps retransmitting SYNACKs. While the other end (the client) is doing 
it's best to ACK them (correctly) and it also tries to send some data 
which never gets through and retransmissions are attempted for it (those 
packets also contain a ACK seqno that should be enough to end the 
SYN-RECV but for some reason that never happens). Eventually the 
connection is RSTed.

I'll look through 2.6.24..25 history once I have some time to see if 
there are some clues about the cause. I'm also having a problem in 
figurin out why would the frto patch you tested solve this issue (unless 
there are two issues in the picture).
