I enabled pr_debug() and there was no error in nf_ct_frag6_gather().
It seems to have defragmented the packet correctly. As expected,
ipv6_defrag() returns NF_STOLEN for the first packet after queuing it.
For the next fragment, ipv6_defrag() calls nf_ct_frag6_output() after
after reassembling it. I checked skb->len inside nf_ct_frag6_output()
and it implies that they were indeed reassembled. Now from what I
follow from the code, this function seems to iterate over both the
fragments with corresponding skb's and incrementing
thresh(NF_IP6_PRI_CONNTRACK_DEFRAG) by 1 so the subsequent hooks
(ip6table_raw_hook, ipv6_conntrack_in, ip6table_mangle_hook) should
get called in order for both the fragments. This works fine for the
first fragment as I had mentioned, but the ip6table_raw_hook returns
NF_DROP for the second fragment. Please let me know if you need more
inputs.

Thanks,
Rahul
