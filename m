	Agreed, packet processing does not check for any
limits for the sync_queues lists. This can be addressed
additionally, may be there can be some wakeup if threshold
is reached, so that we wake up the master thread early.
But there is always the problem that we do not know how
deep/free is the socket buffer, after how much time the
master thread will wakeup... We have to select some arbitrary
number again.

	Can you explain more? Are you referring to the
2-second buffer delay?

	200 is arbitrary, 20% of txqueuelen, a way to avoid
large bursts. It is the 'pause = max(1, (pause >> 1));' part
that also matters because we try to increase the wakeup rate, so
that socket buffer is below 50%. We assume sync traffic rate
does not change much but we are still prepared to avoid
drops while pause > 1 jiffie. If sync rate is too high may be
we should wakeup the master thread in sb_queue_tail.

	The above logic should be read like this:

- limit bursts to min(200, half of guessed socket buffer size)
- limit pause to HZ/4 jiffies in idle periods
- if socket buffer is full try again after 1 jiffie and
increase the wakeups twice, so that we do not hit the
socket limit again

	We should start with something. Better ideas are
always welcome.

	Before now we dropped messages due to large fixed sleep time.
They were dropped when socket buffer was full. Dropping messages is
not nice just because we decided to sleep longer than needed.
With the change we still drop messages but not before pause
reaches 1 jiffie. As we can not use lower sleep time only
additional wakeup in sb_queue_tail can keep up with higher
sync rates. May be we should decide to drop messages only
when some max limit for packets in sync_queues is reached.
