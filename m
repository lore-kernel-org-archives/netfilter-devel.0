I see. Well I'm fine with this way to switch on/off things, just
wanted some clafication.

Still one final thing I'd like to remove before inclusion:

+       union hmark_ports       port_mask;
+       union hmark_ports       port_set;
+       __u32                   spi_mask;
+       __u32                   spi_set;

the spi_mask seems redundant. The port_mask already provides u32 for
it.

In case you want to support different masks for AH/ESP and TCP, you
could do the following:

iptables -I PREROUTING -t mangle -p esp -j HARK --spi-mask 0xffff0000
iptables -I PREROUTING -t mangle -p tcp -j HARK --port-mask 0xfffc

Any objection?

Yes, you'll have to change user-space again, but we have time for
that.

That's still not enough to guarantee that the mark will be consistent
if NAT is in user, but I don't mind recovering the swap and add some
comment on the code to explain this if this makes your life easier.
