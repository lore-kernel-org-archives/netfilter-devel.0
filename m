If DF is set and the MTU is exceeded (for the SYN packet) at a
hop further away, the original host will not understand that it
needs to allow for the MSS option being added.

(Header + Data + New MSS Option) can't exceed 576 bytes and
there's no way to know that more than 576 bytes is allowed
because the ICMP error message may not go via the same host that
is mangling the packet.

Of course, it could just allow fragmentation for this one SYN
packet but that doesn't work for IPv6.

The TCPMSS target can be applied to more than just one direction
of traffic. I'm modifying incoming traffic too, so adding the MSS
option and setting it to over 536 is wrong (although the first ICMP
error will fix it).

Existing users use this target precisely because their hosts are
sending an unwanted MSS value, so it will never need to be added.

The first version is ok with me. Only SYN packets with data and
no MSS option will be dropped. William objects to ever adding the
MSS option.

Although ideally SYN packets with data and no MSS option should
be accepted without adding an option. Dropping arbitrary traffic
(especially when new kernels allow data to be sent with SYN
packets) is not a good idea. If that is ok with you then I'll
make another patch to do it and update the comments.
