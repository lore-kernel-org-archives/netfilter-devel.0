The original tuple may not be updated, but the reply tuple is.
And we are taking the reply tuple in

	tuple_ptr =3D &ct->tuplehash[IP_CT_DIR_REPLY].tuple;

which is subsequently copied to conn->tuple on the first invocation.

Afterwards, SNAT will update ct->tuplehash[reply].tuple, and so
conn->tuple is outdated. Calling nf_conntrack_find_get(conn->tuple)
in count_them would then fail, would it not?
