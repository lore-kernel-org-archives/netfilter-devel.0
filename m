They are supposed to be dropped until hook is there.
However, Nikolay Alexandrov just (correctly...) pointed out to me via irc that this mutex
abuse is against the rules (lock/unlock in different threads!).

So, please toss this series.

Right.  I had planned to send a revert for patch 1 at some point,
plus a change to default to 0.

Thats what I thought, but we now also have per-bridge sysfs knobs,
i.e. sysctl could be 0 and someone enabling br42->call_iptables ....

Its doable, but it gets ugly.
I don't think its worth the pain to care about "sometimes
enabled/disabled".
