Welcome to the green. You will find the most complete Netfilter stack
here :)

The "raw" table is populated by SUSE SFW2 with rules to exempt all
loopback packets from connection tracking since SFW2 at the same time
unconditionally allows all lo transfers in the "filter" table.

In my opinion, NETFILTER_ADVANCED should be changed to only control
the visibility of all suboptions, i.e. I suggest that "default m if
NETFILTER_ADVANCED=n" be done for all non-deprecated modules.
(Similar to how CONFIG_EXPERT works.)

Unless one wants to argue that "that's a detail left to the distro
makers" and "people not compiling kernels would never run into this
issue".
