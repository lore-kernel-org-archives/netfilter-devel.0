Given the size of tcp and gro this shouldn't be an issue.
We'd still fit into 40 bytes cb, and, if that would be a problem we
could still go with (more complex) external storage scheme.

Sure, absolutely.  skb->cb increase is out of question.

I don't think its a problem though, qdisc private info could even be
reduced to 16 (2 pointers on 64bit which I think is a reasonable size to
provide for qdiscs).  Infiniband has similar hack.

And tcp cb has to embed  inet/inet6 as well.

We wouldn't even need to pull of this stunt actually, we could just zap
the skb instead of reinjection... But that would induce e.g. a syn
retransmit which I want to avoid.

Please not stateless (IP) nat, it usually bites users due to lack
of helpers...  I've no problem with mac mangling.

Yes, but it will be a long time before we can remove this thing.

I'm still not convinced we even need lookups in the forward case since
the skb can never leave br_netfilter context.

And we only need to store the physin/out ports, nothing else, so its a
bit sad that we need to add such lookup stuff in the first place :-/

I agree that it would still be better than the skb->nf_bridge
indirection, though.

I don't see how this is easily fixable, sorry -- it would mean we'd have
to dev_hold right after allocation of nf_bridge_info struct...

We can store ifindexes of physin/physout and re-lookup, sure.

I'll start on the central storage infrastructure.
Do you want me to base it on the current patches i have or on plain
nf-next?

Thanks.
