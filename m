The original one won't be - that is, basically you will be making the
initial upstream submission.
However, you are right; fabricating two patches is a good idea and
is in fact what I advertise too (xt_TEE discussion about specifying
oif..) - avoiding a singular huge patch is a best practice.
Just be sure to have condition plus its 32-bit upgrade patch merged at
the same time.
