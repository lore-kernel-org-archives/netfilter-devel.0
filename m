hello Stuart,
           Thanks for the reply. Which kernel
parameter
for Bridge to be enabled. I have RH9 with 2.4.20-8
kernel installed and i found nearly all kernel
parameters with word bridging enabled. Also i try
brctl command at console prompt but no utility is
present in my linux.
          one more thing how can i see packets to
parse them?

regards,
cranium.
