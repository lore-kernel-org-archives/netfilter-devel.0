All the way to some other thread?  That is a serious escape!  ;-)

I suspect that your cookie and my counter are quite similar.

Well, that is why I needed to appeal to compiler magic or an API
extension.  Either way, the pointer returned from rcu_dereference()
must be tagged with the ID of the outermost rcu_read_lock() that
covers it.  Then that tag must be checked against that of the outermost
rcu_read_lock() when it is dereferenced.  If we introduced yet another
set of RCU API members (shudder!) with which to wrapper your
ptr->field use, we could associate additional storage with the
pointer to hold the cookie/counter.  And then use sparse to enforce
use of the new API.

Of course, if we were using C++, we could define a template for pointers
returned by rcu_dereference() in order to make this work.  Now, where
did I put that asbestos suit, you know, the one with the titanium
pinstripes?  ;-)

But even that has some "interesting" issues.  To see this, let's
modify your example a bit:

	rcu_read_lock();

	...

	rcu_read_lock_bh();

	ptr = rcu_dereference(x);
	if (!ptr)
		return NULL;
	...


	rcu_read_unlock_bh();

	...
	/* no reload of x, ptr might be now stale/freed */
	if (ptr->field) { ... }

	...

	rcu_read_unlock();


Now, is it the rcu_read_lock() or the rcu_read_lock_bh() that protects
the rcu_dereference()?

							Thanx, Paul
