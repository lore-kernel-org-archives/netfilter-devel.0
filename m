Yes its a false positive.

Yes, but you could also run a kernel with both commits:

We now block BH for each cpu we are "summing", instead of blocking BH
for the whole 16 possible cpus summation. (so BH should be blocked for
smaller amount of time)

Yes, so current kernel is a bit better.

Note that even with the 'false positive' problem, we had to blocks BH
for the current cpu sum, so the max BH latency is probably the same wit=
h
