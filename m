Sorry might not have made myself clear, after an SNAT with your patch
the packet is re injected into route_me_harder, thus the packet is able
to be rerouted (sent out another interface for example)=20

What this would mean is a packet could meet your iptable rules with is
PRE-SNAT details and then actually behave differently once it has been
SNAT'ed (and not get checked)
