The script completed - although at some point I hit an fd limit - I think I have 
an fd leak in netperf somewhere :( .

Anyhow, there are still some netperfs that end-up kicking the bucket during the 
run - I suspect starvation because where in the other configs (no iptables, and 
empty iptables) each netperf seems to consume about 50% of a CPU - stands to 
reason - 64 netperfs, 32 cores - in the "full" case I see many netperfs consuming 
100% of a CPU.  My gut is thinking that one or more netperf contexts gets stuck 
doing something on behalf of others.  There is also ksoftirqd time for a few of 
those processes.

Anyhow, the spread on trans/s/netperf is now 600 to 500 or 6000, which does 
represent an improvement.

PS - just to be certain that running-out of fd's didn't skew the results I'm 
rerunning the script with ulimit -n 10240 and will see if that changes the 
results any.  And I suppose I need to go fd leak hunting in netperf omni code :(
