hello Michal,

GSO should be capable of computing the checksum on individual segments
later, so I also think the warning can be removed.

Small nit: may I suggest you to call skb_csum_hwoffload_help() instead of
skb_checksum_help(), so that we avoid corrupting SCTP packets in case they
hit xt_CHECKSUM target?

thank you in advance,
