At this point, it beats the heck out of me!  ;-)

Yeah, if I had seen a compelling use case...  Oleg's task_work case was
closest, but given that it involved a task-local lock that shouldn't
be all -that- heavily contended, it is hard to see there being all that
much difference.

But maybe I am missing something here?  Wouldn't be the first time...
