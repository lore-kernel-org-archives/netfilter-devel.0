But then, maybe your problem comes from your code : timeStamp should be=
=20
declared as "struct timeval" of course, to get both tv_sec and tv_usec.

struct timeval tv;
ioctl(sock, SIOCSTAMP, &tv);
printf("packet arrived at %ld.%06ld\n", (long)tv.tv_sec, (long)tv.tv_us=
ec);


If you *want* nanosecond resolution instead of microsecond, use :

struct timespec ts;
ioctl(sock, SIOCSTAMPNS, &ts);
printf("packet arrived at %ld.%09ld\n", (long)ts.tv_sec, (long)ts.tv_ns=
ec);
