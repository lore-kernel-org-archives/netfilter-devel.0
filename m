Can you rely on being told when the dump completes?
If the program is killed in the middle then it can't tell you.

I suspect you'd have to suppress resize for some time interval
after a partial dump.
Unfortunately two continuous dumps would be likely to suppress
it forever. Maybe sleep user space dump requests for the first
block while any resize (esp. grow) is pending.

What is passed to userspace as the 'continue from here' marker?
Even without resize there are likely to be issues if something
nearer the head of a hash chain being processed is deleted.
