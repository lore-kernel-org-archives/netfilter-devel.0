>=20

size is not a power of two here.

I prefer to let admins chose their size, since it makes attacker life m=
ore=20
difficult :)

=46or example, I can tell you I have a server, were size is between 2.0=
00.000=20
and 3.500.000, I dont want to be forced to use 2097152

A multiply is cheap, at least on current hardware.
