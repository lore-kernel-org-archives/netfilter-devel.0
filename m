Sorry, I messed this patch up a bit and will repost.

* I still have not addressed any of the problems beyond the
  original scope of my post, which was to rebase Hans's changes.
  In particular I have not addressed any of the issues that
  Julian raised in response to my patches. Hans, are you planning
  to look into that or should I take another stab at things?
