Okay, will do!

See:
include/linux/netfilter/xt_LOG.h (user space part).

+struct xt_log_info_v1 {
+       unsigned char level;
+       unsigned char logflags;
+       char prefix[30];
+
+       char ring_name[30];
+       unsigned long ring_siVs.ze;
+};

Here is no context pointer.

I'll fix the unsigned long issue.

Will fix!
