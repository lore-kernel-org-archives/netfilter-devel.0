	This function is called under __ip_vs_mutex, so
there is single writer that modifies the configuration.
As "readers" the schedulers access the configuration under
rcu_read_lock (eg. called in tcp_conn_schedule) but they
are free to use other locking too. ip_vs_wlc.c scheduler
is example where sched_lock is not used because only
svc->destinations is accessed which is protected with RCU
by definition. You can check __ip_vs_unlink_dest() how
dest is unlinked with list_del_rcu() before sched->del_dest
method is called.
