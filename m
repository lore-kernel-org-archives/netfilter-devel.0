I am not sure I am following here.  Can you elaborate?
Maybe I was a bit too vague, so let me try to clarify.

The GSO segmentation avoidance patch requires userspace support, including large
recv buffer size (i.e., 64k + a few byte netlink overhead).

It will be off by default, userspace needs to enable it when it binds
the nfqueue.

What I was pointing out is that for mmap'd netlink you usually need
to allocate enough slots so the ring can handle e.g. 1024 packets.

For the 64k packet case, that would be >64 MB mmap-ring.

I'm not saying its a problem, just wanted to point it out.

[ 64k is probably rare enough to have mmap-users fallback to recv,
  and your patches already support this ].

Cheers,
Florian
