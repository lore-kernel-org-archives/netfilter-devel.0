It does look like we might lose precision here because of 64bit to 32bit
conversion, but I am not sure how much it matters here. Iirc this is how
it used to be before rev2 code.

Agreed, this code does not get executed too often for us to worry about
div_u64 being slow. And it reverts back to regular division on 64 bit
arch anyways.
