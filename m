commit e179e6322ac334e21a3c6d669d95bc967e5d0a80
(netfilter: bridge-netfilter: Fix MAC header handling with IP DNAT)
breaks DNAT when the destination address sits on the same bridgeport
the packet originally arrived on.  Example:

( Network1 ) -- [ eth1-Bridge-eth0 ] -- ( Network2 )

Lets assume bridge has ip 192.168.10.8, and following netfilter rules
are active:

-A PREROUTING  -s 192.168.10.1 -d 192.168.10.8 -p tcp --dport 21 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.10.1
-A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.10.1 -d 192.168.10.1 -p tcp --dport 21 -j SNAT --to-source 192.168.10.8

With kernels before 2.6.35, this makes host 192.168.10.1 connecting to
the bridge on port 21 connect-to-self.

>From 2.6.35 onwards this no longer works since the natted packet travels
through the bridge forward logic, where should_deliver() refuses to send
the packet because the destination bridge port is the same as the
originating port.

Enabling hairpin mode on eth1 makes it work, but still causes
problems because the original client finds its own mac address as the
packets source (it used to be the bridge MAC).

This patch tries to fix this in the following manner:
- tag all skbs with dnat-applied with BRDIGED_DNAT flag
- modify bridge fwd logic to detect "same-bridgeport-and-dnat'd"
  condition, permit this, and flag skb accordingly
- in bridge postrouting, replace source mac with bridge mac addess
  if skb is such a dnat-to-same-port.

 Bart,

 it would be great if you could look into this, as I am not very familiar
 with net/bridge/.

 Especially,
 1) is it safe to set BRNF_BRIDGED_DNAT unconditionally in br_nf_pre_routing_finish_bridge() ?
 2) is it ok to memcpy to eth_hdr() in br_nf_post_routing() [ considering there might be encap headers
    that were removed? ]
