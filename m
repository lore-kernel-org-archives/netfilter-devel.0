Yeah, of course. My worry is that this problem is more than just
IPv6 reassembly.

It is a different warning from use-after-free, this one is about sleep
in atomic context, mutex lock is acquired with RCU read lock held.

The context is process context (TX path before hitting qdisc), and
BH is not disabled, so in_interrupt() doesn't catch it. Hmm, this
makes me thinking maybe we really need to disable BH in this
case for nf_hook()? But it is called in RX path too, and BH is
already disabled there.
