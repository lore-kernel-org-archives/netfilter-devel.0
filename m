I think you got a change into your tree locally, this went via net-2.6
and thereafterwards it started using merges.  But that's just a guess.

Want some suggestions for work flow? :-)

1) For net-2.6 just clone Linus's tree, pull net-2.6 once as it is
   right now, then leave it alone.

   Periodically sync your origin (which is Linus's tree) via
   "git fetch origin".  This just grabs the objects.

   Then you can just go "git request-pull origin $(GIT_URL)" and
   it'll just work.

   Since the likelyhood for conflicts in the net-2.6 tree with
   your netfilter work is incredibly unlikely, doing a merge
   should never be necessary.  But if it is just go
   "git pull origin".

2) For net-next-2.6 use net-next-2.6 as your "origin" (you can change
   this in .git/config), conflicts are more likely so every once in
   a while a "git pull origin" will be necessary.

If that doesn't work out or feel comfortable for you, that's
fine.
