Maybe I'm not seeing everything but from this patch and what
you sent me last time ([PATCH 0/9 WIP] nf_tables: set extensions
and dynamic updates) it appears that NFT_SET_EXT_KEY is always
present so if you always added it first to the template it would
be at a fixed offset, no?

But whatever, I don't really care about this so go ahead and add
the key length to obj_hash.

Cheers,
