Thanks Jesper. This effect without inlinging was to be expected I guess.
The interesting question would be a patch that uses nf_hook() without okfn
callback, moves the ingress qdisc to register with the netfilter ingress
hook and moves the TTL tracking of ing_filter() to the ingress qdisc,
where it belongs.

My expectation would be that this would result in an overall performance
gain.
