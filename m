I don't like adding this special behaviour for NAT, people need
to adjust their rulesets for filtering etc. anyway. We could stop
rerouting packets in between transforms (when both dst->xfrm and
IPSKB_XFRM_TRANSFORMED are set), but this is inconsistent with what
happens on input, when a packet is DNATed in PRE_ROUTING it does
affect the SA lookup. So I think I'd prefer handling this case in
xfrm[46]_output_finish, but I need to think about it a bit more.
