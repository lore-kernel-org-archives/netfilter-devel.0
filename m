One possible way to handle this is to have users like TCP grow
quicker than 2x. Maybe start with 16x and grow slower and slower
using a log function. (No, we do not want rhashtable congestion
control algos ;-)

Let's say we start with an initial table size of 16K (we can make
this system memory depenend) and we grow by 8x. New inserts go
into the new table immediately so as soon as we have 12K entries
we'll grow right to 128K buckets. As we grow above 75K we'll start
growing to 1024K buckets. New entries already go to the 1024K
buckets at this point given that the first grow cycle should be
fast. The 2nd grow cycle would take an est 6 RCU grace periods.
This would also still give us a max of 8K bucket locks which
should be good enough as well.

Just thinking this out loud. Still working on this.

Another option is to only call the grow_decision once every N inserts
or removals (32? 64?) and handle updates as batches. No objection
to ditching the grow/shrink function for now though. Not sure we
anyone actually needs different growth semantics.
