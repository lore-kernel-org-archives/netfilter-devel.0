maybe further discussion  would clarify this point..

If you are using a netdev as a reference point, then I take it 
if you add vlans should be possible to do multiple zones on a single
physical netdev? Or is there some other way to satisfy that?

Ok - makes sense. 
i.e NAT would work; and policy routing as well as arp would be fine.
Also it looks to be sufficiently useful to fit a specific use case you
are interested in.
But back to my question on routing, ipsec etc (and you may not be
interested in solving this problem, but it is what i was getting to
earlier). Lets take for example: 
a) network tables like SAD/SPD tables: how you would separate those on a
per-zone basis? i.e 10.0.0.1/zone1 could use different
policy/association than 10.0.0.1/zone2
b) dynamic protocols (routing, IKE etc): how do you do that without 
making both sides understand what is going on?

Refer to my statements above for an example.

Agreed. But the major ones like iproute2 etc could be taught. We have
namespaces in the kernel already, over a period of time I think changing
the user space tools would a sensible evolution.

My contention is that it is a lot less headache to just virtualize 
all the network stack and then use what you want than it is to go and
selectively changing the network objects.
Note: if i wanted today i could run racoon on every namespace 
unchanged and it would work or i could modify racoon to understand
namespaces...

Thats what i was looking for ..
So the difference, to pick the 150 zones example so as to put a number
around it, is namespaces will consume 150.X bytes (where X is the
overhead of a conntrack table) and you approach will be (X + 152) bytes,
correct?
What is the typical sizeof X?

I think the challenge is whether zones will have to encroach on other
net stack objects or not. You are already touching structure netdev...
A digression: TOS is different really - it has network level semantic. This 
would be more like mark or in some cases ifindex (i.e local semantics)

tru dat - it only gives you one semantical axis and you need an
additional dimension in your case (namespace have that resolved via
struct net).
