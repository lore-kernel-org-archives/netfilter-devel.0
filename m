It's always been the case that if you want to do L2 or lower level
stuff, you use the ingress classifier, packet actions, and qdiscs.

If you want to do higher level things, NF hooks provide that facility.

The only example I've seen is packet counting, and one could do that
just as easily with the ingress qdisc.

So given what I've been shown so far I'm very far from convinced that
this new hook in an already over polluted, most critical of all
critical code paths, is justified at all.
