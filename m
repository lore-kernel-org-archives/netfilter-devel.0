I'm wondering, why not just do a two-liner, along the lines of:

	for_each_online_cpu(cpu)
		smp_send_reschedule(cpu);

That should trigger a quiescent state on all online cpus. It wont 
perturb the scheduler state (which is reschedule-IPI invariant).
(And this is a big-hammer approach anyway so even if it did we 
wouldnt care.)

Am i missing something embarrasingly obvious perhaps?
