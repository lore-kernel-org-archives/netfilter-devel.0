The MSS option is for the MRU of whoever sent the SYN packet. There's no
way of knowing this information so it's not possible to avoid using an
MSS that is too large. With no option, "any" segment size could be used,
which implies 536 to match the MRU of 576.

The other reason for not being able to add it is that it may increase the
packet size beyond an MRU/MTU limit if there is data. There's no guarantee
we'll see an ICMP error message if this occurs, because the limit doesn't
have to be local and the return path does not need to be the same. The
original host won't know that the packet is going to be increased in size.
