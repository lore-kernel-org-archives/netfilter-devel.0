Actually, first of all, let's not start with larger tables.

The network namespace folks showed clearly that hash tables
are detrimental to per-ns memory costs.  So they definitely
want us to start with extremely small tables.

But once we know something is actively used, sure, increase
the table grow rate as a response to demand.

So how feasible is it to grow by 4x, 8x, or other powers of
two in one resize operation?
