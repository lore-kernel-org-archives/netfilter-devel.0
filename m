You shouldn't use hash:ip with ranges for IPv4 too because the range
members are added individually, which is less efficient both memory
and performance wise, see:

 $ ipset create foo hash:ip hashsize 64
 $ ipset add foo 192.168.1.0/30
 $ ipset list foo
 Name: foo
 Type: hash:ip
 Header: family inet hashsize 64 maxelem 65536 
 Size in memory: 628

 192.168.1.3
 192.168.1.2
 192.168.1.0
 192.168.1.1
