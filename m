Well you raised the concern before -- namely that kdboe would have
the very same feature. And yet, kdboe was not part of the kernel.
Neither is the magical stand-alone module.
I really prefer to have it in rather than out, because I know
that's going to mess up maintenance-here-and-there. I'm already
having a big time with xtables-addons that still carries
xt_condition and SYSRQ for a while, and it does have some different
code lines than the kernel copy.
