Thanks, changes.

Yeah this is a stupid habit that doesn't matter anyway, in all
jurisdictions I care about copyright duration is based on the
lifetime of the author. I'll try to find out whether just adding
a copyright statement without any specific year would be fine
for my purposes.

I'll think about it. If you want to send a patch, please go ahead ;)

So we'd have SNPMAP and DNPMAP. I like NPMAP, but SNPMAP and DNPMAP
don't sound that much better, so I think I prefer keeping the currently
used abrevation of Network Prefix Translation. I don't care much though.

Well, I think people using computers are used to tons of similar
sounding acronyms and abrevations. They'll manage ;)

I've been proposing to lift the mangle restriction on all targets
for years. Basically the only special thing about the mangle table
is rerouting on mark changes. Everything else works just fine in
other tables (with NAT being somewhat special as well), even marking
packets if you don't need rerouting, its even more performant in that
case since no extra routing lookups need to be done. So I don't see
a reason to impose artificial limitations.

Yes, if connection tracking is used (which is not necessary of course)
its best to exclude the translated packets from tracking. There's
actually a lot of potential for improvement here. One thing is telling
connection tracking, if its used, about the translations, so it can
properly track packets. Another thing is, with stateless translation
you still need ALGs to take care of addresses in layer 7 protocols.
I've been thinking about how to make the existing NAT helpers work
without conntrack and NAT, but its not easy and requires a lot of
restructuring of the existing code. Its something we can still add
later, its something that just affects the kernel.
