Hi Pablo,

Could you share what performance you're getting when doing nft
filter equivalent to 'tcpdump port 22' ?
Meaning your filter needs to parse eth->proto, ip or ipv6 header and
check both ports. How will it compare with JITed bpf/ebpf ?

I was trying to go the other way: improve nft performance with ebpf.
10/40G links are way to fast for interpreters. imo JIT is the only way.

here are some comments about patches:
1/9:
-       if (fp->bpf_func != sk_run_filter)
-               module_free(NULL, fp->bpf_func);
+       if (fp->run_filter != sk_run_filter)
+               module_free(NULL, fp->run_filter);

David suggested that these comparisons in all jits are ugly.
I've fixed it in my patches. When they're in, you wouldn't need to
mess with this.

2/9:
-       atomic_sub(sk_filter_size(fp->len), &sk->sk_omem_alloc);
+       atomic_sub(fp->size, &sk->sk_omem_alloc);

that's a big change in socket memory accounting.
We used to account for the whole sk_filter... now you're counting
filter size only.
Is it valid?

7/9:
whole nft_expr_autoload() looks scary from security point of view.
If I'm reading it correctly, the code will do request_module() based on
userspace request to attach filter?

9/9:
+       case SO_NFT_GET_FILTER:
+               len = sk_nft_get_filter(sk, (struct sock_filter __user
*)optval, len);
with my patches there was a concern regarding socket checkpoint/restore
and I had to preserve existing filter image to make sure it's not broken.
Could you please coordinate with Pavel and co to test this piece?

What will happen if nft_filter attached, but so_get_filter is called? crash?

+static int nft_sock_expr_autoload(const struct nft_ctx *ctx,
+                                 const struct nlattr *nla)
+{
+#ifdef CONFIG_MODULES
+       mutex_unlock(&nft_expr_info_mutex);
+       request_module("nft-expr-%.*s", nla_len(nla), (char *)nla_data(nla));
+       mutex_lock(&nft_expr_info_mutex);

same security concern here...

+int sk_nft_attach_filter(char __user *optval, struct sock *sk)
+{

what about sk_clone_lock()? since filter program is in nft, do you need to do
special steps during copy of socket?

+       fp = sock_kmalloc(sk, sizeof(struct sk_filter) + size, GFP_KERNEL);

this may allocate more memory then you need.
Currently sk_filter_size() computes it in an accurate way.

Also the same issue of optmem accounting as I mentioned in 2/9

+err4:
+       sock_kfree_s(sk, fp, size);

a small bug: allocated sizeof(sk_filter)+size, but freeing 'size' only...

Overall I think it's very interesting work.
Not sure what's the use case for it though.

I'll cook up a patch for the opposite approach (use ebpf inside nft)
and will send you for review.
I would prefer to work together to satisfy your and our user requests.

Thanks
Alexei
