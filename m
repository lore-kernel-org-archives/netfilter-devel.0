Wrt the other mail, just thinking out loud ... do you see a longer-term
possibility of further generalizing the gen hooks infrastructure, so that
actually classifier from tc could attach (disregarding the nf_* naming
scheme for now) ...

     `-> nf_hook_slow()
      `-> [for each entry in hook list]   <-- here as an entry
       `-> nf_iterate()
        `-> (*elemp)->hook()

... as well?

Thanks,
Daniel
