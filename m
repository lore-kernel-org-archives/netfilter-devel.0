That's what I suspect too. There is still the possibility of skbs
"jumping" through the stack between ip_defrag callers, the same
problem that caused the crashes on conntrack module unload fixed
by Olaf Kirch some time ago. This could theoretically cause skbs
from PRE_ROUTING to show up in POST_ROUTING and continue from
there on if NAT is used. Perhaps we should add a "user"-argument
to ip_defrag and keep fragment queues private to a single user.
