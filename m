Somehow, the first part of this email went missing. Not critical,
but for completeness:

These two patches each add an xtables match.

The xt_priority match is a straighforward addition in the style of
xt_mark, adding the option to filter on one more sk_buff field. I
have an immediate application for this. The amount of code (in
kernel + userspace) to add a single check proved quite large.
