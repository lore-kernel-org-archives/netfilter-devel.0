True, what an awful dependency chain.

NEW_LEDS requires HAS_IOMEM.  This is to handle platforms like
S390 and UM.

But I think this protection is overboard.  Specific drivers
might need IOMEM functionality, but the basic infrastructure
does not.

All of the core infrastrucure and generic LEDS facilities, including
NEW_LEDS, LEDS_CLASS, and LEDS_TRIGGERS, don't need the IOMEM
protection.

And neither do the LED device drivers, they already each have a
depenency for a specific platform.

You could even imagine a hypervisor based LED driver that a platform
like S390, which does not enable HAS_IOMEM, might want to support
under this infrastructure.

I think NEW_LEDS can be completely eliminated.
