But what state could be associated by conntrack to the uncompleted 
fragments but the INVALID state? In consequence, in any sane setup, the 
uncompleted fragments will be dropped silently by a filter table rule
and no ICMP error message will be sent back.

Therefore I think iff the destination of the fragments is the host 
itself, then conntrack should generate an ICMP error message. But that 
error message must be processed by conntrack to set its state and then 
the fate of the generated packet can be decided by a rule.

Best regards,
Jozsef
