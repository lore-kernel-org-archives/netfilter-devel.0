An update here since I've had some interactions with Pablo off list.

Further testing shows that the underlying cause of the different test
results is a udp packet that has a bogus source port number.  In the
test the server process tries to send an ack to the bogus port and the
flow is disrupted.

Notes:
- The packet with the bad source port is from a sendmsg() call that
has hit the connection tracker clash code introduced by 71d8c47fc653
- Packets are successfully sent after the bad one, from the same
socket, with the correct source port number
- The problem does not reproduce with 71d8c47fc653 reverted, or
without nf_conntrack loaded
- The bogus port numbers start at 1024, bumping up by 1 every few
times the problem occurs (1025, 1026, etc.)
- The patch above does not change the behaviour
- Enabling lockdep does not show anything

Our workaround for the original race was to retry sendmsg() once on
EPERM errors, and that had been effective.
I can trigger the insertion clash easily with some simple test code,
but I have not been able so far to reproduce the packets with bad
source port numbers with some simpler code that I could share.

Thanks,
Marc
