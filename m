You can get a similar effect by (ab)using the iflink field i.e. set
the iflink to the parent interface and modify
ip_tables.c:ip_packet_match to check the ifindex (or iflink if
defined) for a match.  An advantage of this is that it doesn't require
adding any new fields and the only kernel change is to
ip_tables.c:ip_packet_match (and its caller).  That said, an explicit
group (or zone as various firewall vendors call it) is cleaner.
