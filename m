We are talking about a static variable usable only within a single file,
where is the problem ? A nice comment can have this effect.

I'm talking about good practice to help code review. This is way more
important than the potential "encapsulation" benefit of hiding global
state (a static variable) within the body of a function.

I remember that Andrew Morton has strong opinions about this, and I
remember being in complete agreement with him on the topic.

Thanks,

Mathieu
