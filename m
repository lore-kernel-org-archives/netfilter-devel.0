Thanks for the test and feedback. No other comments are added after
the RFC. Maybe because it lacks the IPv6 support.

There is another issue: when calculating MSS, we'd better check the
MSS of the forward path too. However, as it works in RAW table, and no
DNAT/REDIRECT is performed, we may get the wrong info.
