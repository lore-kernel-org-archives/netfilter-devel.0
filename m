Yes, I am working on the next generation of ulogd (ulogd-2).  It will
allow you to stack multiple plugins on top of each other, such as:

ctnetlink -> ipfix

or=20

ulog -> packet parser -> flow_aggrgation -> ipfix=20

or even exporting per-packet data in ipfix=20

ulog -> packet parser -> ipfix

It's far from complete, but I'm almost finished with the core and can
start to write the plugins:
http://svn.gnumonks.org/branches/ulog/ulogd2/

This is arguable.  Why not once the packet was receieved on the incoming
wire?  If you are Ingress router of your network, your ISP bills you for
the amout of traffic it sends to your ingress router.

OTOTH, for egress traffic I agree.

Sure, it can be done... but you need to grab ip_conntrack_lock in order
to do so.

It doesn't help.  Currently we still have one global rwlock for all
conntrack's.  There are patches for per-bucket locking. =20

But well, as long as the usage count of ip_conntrack doesn't drop to
zero (which we're guaranteed since our skb still references it), and we
don't need to walk the hash table, we don't actually need to grab
ip_conntrack_lock.   A seperate accounting lock would be possible.

Somebody needs to implement this and run profiles...

sounds fine to me.  But this basically means that we would hide
conntrack counters behind generic API - the counters themselves are
stored in our own data structure.
