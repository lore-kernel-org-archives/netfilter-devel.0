OK, some reasons from the interface point of view:

1) It provides an extensible interface to userspace. We didn't
   invented a new wheel in that regard, we just reused the
   extensibility of TLVs used in netlink as intermediate format
   between user and kernelspace, also used many other applications
   outthere. The TLV parsing and building is not new code, most that of
   that code has been exposed to userspace already through netlink.

2) It shows that, with little generalisation, we can open the door to
   one single *classification interface* for the users. Just make some
   little googling, you'll find *lots of people* barfing on the fact that
   we have that many interfaces to classify packets in Linux. And I'm
   *not* talking about the packet classification approach itself, that's a
   different debate of course.

OK, some comments in that regard:

1) Simplicity: With the nft approach you can just use a filter
expressed in json, eg.

{"rule":
 {"expr":[
  {"type":"meta","dreg":1,"key":"protocol"},
  {"type":"cmp","sreg":1,"op":"eq","cmpdata":{"data_reg":{"type":"value","len":2,"data0":"0x00000008"}}},
  {"type":"payload","dreg":1,"offset":9,"len":1,"base":"network"},
  {"type":"cmp","sreg":1,"op":"eq","cmpdata":{"data_reg":{"type":"value","len":1,"data0":"0x00000006"}}},
  {"type":"immediate","dreg":0,"immediatedata":{"data_reg":{"type":"verdict","verdict":"0xffffffff"}}}]
 }
}

Which is still more readable and easier to maintain that a BPF
snippet. So you just pass it to the json parser in the libnftnl
library (or whatever other better minimalistic library we would ever
have) which transforms this to TLV format that you can pass to the
kernel.  The kernel will do the job to translate this.

How are users going to integrate the restricted C's eBPF code
infrastructure into their projects? I don't think that will be simple.
They will likely include the BPF snippet to avoid all the integration
burden, as it already happens in many projects with BPF filters.

2) Performance. Patrick has been doing many progress with the generic
   set infrastructure for nft. In that regard, we aim to achieve
   performance by arranging data using performance data structures,
   *jit is not the only way to boost performance* (although we also
   want to have it).

Some example:

   set type IPv4 address = { N thousands of IPv4 addresses }

   reg1 <- payload(network header, offsetof(struct iphdr, daddr), 4)
   lookup(reg1, set)
   reg0 <- immediate(0xffffffff)

Or even better, using dictionaries:

   set type IPv4 address = { 1.1.1.1 : accept, 2.2.2.2 : accept, 3.3.3.3 : drop ...}

   reg1 <- payload(network header, offsetof(struct iphdr, daddr), 4)
   reg0 <- lookup(reg1, set)

Where "accept" is an alias of 0xffffffff and "drop" is 0 in the
nft-sock case. The verdict part has been generalised so we can adapt
nft to the corresponding packet classification engine.

This part just needs a follow-up patch to add set-based filtering for
nft-sockets. See this for more information about ongoing efforts on
the nft set infrastructure: http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/326368/
that will also integrate into nft-sock.

Right, you can extend interfaces forever with lots of patchwork and
"smart tricks" but that doesn't mean that will look nice...

As I said, I believe that having a nice extensible interface is
extremely important to make it easier for development. If we have to
rearrange the internal representation for some reason, we can do it
indeed without bothering about making translations to avoid breaking
userspace and having to use ugly tricks (just see sk_decode_filter()
or any other translation to support any new way to express a
filter...).

Nope sorry, that's not ebpf. That's assembler code.

nft interface is already well-abstracted from the representation, so I
don't find a good reason to make a step backward that will force us to
represent the instructions using a fixed layout structure that is
exposed to userspace, that we won't be able to change once if this
gets into mainstream.

Probably the nft is not the easiest path, I agree, it's been not so
far if you look at the record. But with time and development hours
from everyone, I believe we'll enjoy a nice framework.
