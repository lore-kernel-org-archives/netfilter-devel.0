I see.  In this case it indeed could be a problem; I was doing this
change with the assumption that prandom is useable at ->checkenty time.

Alright.  Given that this went into -next, I think we have a few weeks to
investigate.

I will check if the specific hash uses are problematic in their own right
(due to lack of reseed) or if they are weakened by this change only.

I'll follow up on this.

Pablo/David, if you think this needs to be fixed RIGHT NOW then please
just issue a revert for a42b99a6e329654d376b330de057eff87686d890.

Thanks!
