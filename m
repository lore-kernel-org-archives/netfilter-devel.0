You're proposing to drop packets, I don't think an error message
after the fact makes up for that :)

Thats true, in this case the userspace program doesn't need to
do anything wrong though.

For unicast its obviously simple, for broadcast you'd need something
like this:

err = 0;
for (all netlink sockets; sk && !err; ...) {
	skb = skb_clone(...)
	if (skb == NULL) {
		if (sk->flags & NETLINK_HIGHLY_RELIABLE)
			err = -ENOBUFS;
		continue;
	}
	...
}

So you're returning an error when at least one of the "reliable"
sockets doesn't get its delivery.
