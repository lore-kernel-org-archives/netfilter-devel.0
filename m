It's very useful to remotely sysrq server machines in large data-center.
Another solution by Prarit Bhargava is denied by David Miller,
see discussion http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/101284/.

xt_SYSRQ solution is more convenience for us to use in inner system.
I hope this solution can be merged to main tree. :-)
But before that, this code need to be fixed (may be need more hashing enhancement).

Read only.
hash algorithm can be changed.

sysrq_seqno is set using current time in sysrq_crypto_init.
Whatever we set, sysrq_seqno is not equal to what we set.

malformed packet should be delivered to udp protocol handing.

Is there 1% possibility for user to send x,x,x,x, type data in udp payload?

register target.

register again. This will cause target list dead loop.
