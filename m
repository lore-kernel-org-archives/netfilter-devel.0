No, no! The pneigh_XXX() *is* the way to do RFC2461 proxying :)
I think Thaler's extended "proxy ARP" for IPv6 needs some other framework.

I still haven't had the time to check how proxy ARP really works in IPv4,
so I might have misunderstood this line in arp.c (line 763):

"(arp_fwd_proxy(in_dev, rt) || pneigh_lookup(&arp_tbl, &tip, dev, 0)))) {"

I think the first check is for proxy ARP, and the second for a router
acting as proxy.

In a similar case for IPv6, we would first need to check for the Thaler
IPv6 "proxy ARP", then for the RFC2461 router as a proxy case.

Well, we still need some way to have the router capture some packets (the
unicast NS messages) it would normally forward.

Ok. Having slept on the matter, here is a new attempt to fix the probem,
which I think is cleaner than the one I proposed earlier. The down side is
of course that all nodes, no matter if they are acting as proxies or not,
will have to do some extra comparisons each time they receive a packet.

Perhaps this is an acceptable trade off for the architectual cleanness.

Ville

Ps. this patch is just a RFC, I haven't had a chance to test it yet!
