I see.
So calling m->XXX may not be a wise long term solution.
Hasan's patch has a call to xtables_option_tpcall(), if that is the 
right interface I hope that going forward if any of the m->parseXX
changes you will take care of hiding all that stuff.

True - but we are getting broken because we are using a call that only 5 
or so users provide. It would have saved us time if we got the
a good log message instead of checking for if !m->parse()

That would be nice - but someone is going to have to link to libxtables, no?
