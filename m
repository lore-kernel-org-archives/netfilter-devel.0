Hmm. What does that mean? What size do capabilities normally have?

Hmm. It actually found something in the pte? Looks like a swap
entry...but that doesn't make sense at that virtual address. Userspace
is below 0x80000000.

That's correct.

Yes, it looks like memory corruption, especially since the page table
appears to be corrupted as well. But I'll have a look and see if the
code that dumps the pte is doing something bogus...

Yes, that would be very valuable.
