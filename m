In theory, resizes should only take the locks for the buckets they're
currently unzipping, and adds should take those same locks.  Neither one
should take a whole-table lock, other than resize excluding concurrent
resizes.  Is that still insufficient?

Yeah, the add/remove statistics used for tracking would need some
special handling to avoid being a table-wide bottleneck.
