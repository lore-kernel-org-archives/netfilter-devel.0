I almost did a few times, but never quite got the code that needed it
working good enough for it to go anywhere.

Right, incrementing one cpu and decrementing another doesn't change the
sum over all cpus :-)

static inline void rcu_read_lock(void)
{
	atomic_rcu_read_lock(&global_atomic_rcu_context);
}

static inline void rcu_read_unlock(void)
{
	atomic_rcu_read_unlock(&global_atomic_rcu_context);
}

static inline void call_rcu(struct rcu_head *rcuhead, void (*func)(struct rcu_head *))
{
	call_atomic_rcu(&global_atomic_rcu_context, rcuhead, func);
}

etc.. Should take care of that, no?

Right. I was thinking along the way of providing a watermark (either
nr_queued based, or time based) and once it exceeds try to drive it from
read_unlock. Or similar. unlock driven RCU implementations have the best
grace period time every, except for all the down sides ;-)

Ok, back on topic :-)

I wouldn't exactly call it a good solution, it does a
for_each_possible_cpu() spin_lock();

 1) that should probably be for_each_online_cpu()

 2) that doesn't scale at all, I'm sure dave's 256-way hurts like mad
    when inserting tons of rules and we do that for every iptable
    modification.

 3) there is no way lockdep can track all that :(

Do we _really_ _really_ __HAVE__ to serialize this? So far I've heard
Patrick say: there might be, a use case. That doesn't sound like: we
should make it dead slow for everybody else.
