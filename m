I agree, this seems to be a step backwards.

Dave doesn't seem to like the rwlock approach. I don't see a way to
do anything asynchronously like call_rcu() to improve this, so to
bring up one of Stephens suggestions again:

We could use this to replace the counters, presuming it is
indeed faster than waiting for a RCU grace period.

Agreed.
