Yes that is what I meant, when I was talking about the pointer that
the nf_queue code holds into the nf_hook list.  That list is threaded
through nf_hook_ops, and is used to retain the place in the nf_hook list
for when the packet returns through nf_reinject.

Yes.  This will apply to more than just nftables when the pernet hooks
are in place.  The try_module_get prevents this for everything except
for nftables today.  So in practice this problem has existed since the
merge of nftables.  The try_module_get shows this problem has existed
in some form longer than git.

Whatever works. I just see this as a bug in the networking stack that
needs to be fixed.  I don't care who I send it to as long as Linus gets
it.

This is a marker that this should be backported to stable, and the
typicall way this is remembered outside of the network trees.  The stable
folks grep the git log for Cc: stable...

The functions in nfnetfilter_queue_core.c are also named drop,
and I am not in a mood to change the convention.

Because we need a race free way to visit all of the network namespaces.
I would perform the for_each_net on the other side of nf_hook_drop but
the rcu locking would not allow that.
