Are you using 2.6.29 with any conntrack helper loaded? In that case this
fix is not in -stable yet.

device_cmp() by nf_ct_iterate_cleanup() when NETDEV_DOWN event is
received. Weird, is your device going down quite often? Another
possibility is that there's some entry stuck in the conntrack table that
we cannot delete, perhaps we're leaking refcounts somewhere.
