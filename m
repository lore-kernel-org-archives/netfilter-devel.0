Yes, you'll have to rebase upon nf-next. First, I have to ask David to
pull from nf to get this fixes, so you'll have to wait a bit. If any
doubt, contact me.

While at it, please, merge patches 09, 10 and 11 in one single patch.

And 12 to 18. We need that the repository has to remain consistent
between two patches.

No problem if the patch seems big as soon as changes belong to the
same scope.
