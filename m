There are lots of other hooks and conntrack/NAT already have a
quite large negative influence on performance. Do you have numbers
that show that enabling this actually causes more than a slight
decrease in performance? Besides, most distributors enable all
these options anyway, so it only makes a difference for a small
group of users.

I don't think we do.

When an ICMP error is send by the firewall itself, the inner
packet needs to be restored to its original state. That means
both DNAT and SNAT which might have been applied need to be
reversed. DNAT is reversed at places where we usually do
SNAT (POST_ROUTING), SNAT is reversed where usually DNAT is
done (PRE_ROUTING/LOCAL_OUT). Since locally generated packets
never go through PRE_ROUTING, it is done in LOCAL_OUT, which
required enabling NAT in LOCAL_OUT unconditionally. It might
be possible to move this to some different hook, I didn't
investigate it.
