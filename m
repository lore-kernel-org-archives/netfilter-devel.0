Exactly. Please add at least the NSTYPE_NSPROXY or whatever, that will
pin all namespaces of a given pid from the very beginning.

This one is done in the patch, no?

Although the approach is OK for me, there's one design issue, that came
up to my mind recently: can we use this fd to wail for a namespace to 
stop? I currently don't see this ability, but this is something I require
badly.

Thoughts?
