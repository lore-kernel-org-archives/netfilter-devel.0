This would work but one would have to check carefully that the pointer
is always set to an usable value. Or we could just add a flag indicating
whether the structure is embedded (and if it is not, use init_net).
Another approach was suggested in the patchworks discussion: add a
special namespace for IPv6 conntrack fragment handling.

I used netfilter on a computer between source and destination of the 
packets (generated with "ping6 -s 3000"):

ip6tables -A FORWARD -o ... -m frag --fragid 0:0xFFFFFFFF --fraglast -j DROP

The --fragid condition is needed to work around a bug in iptables (if 
frag module is loaded and there is no --fragid, only packets with zero
fragment id match - patch for this is already in git). On the target,
packet is defragmented automatically, by default by the "normal" code,
with nf_conntrack_ipv6 module by the conntrack code.

Setting

  echo 5 >/proc/sys/net/ipv6/ip6frag_time
  echo 5 >/proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_frag6_timeout

on target also helps.
