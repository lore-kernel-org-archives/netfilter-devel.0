not at all.  It was just my extremely vague idea about something more
generic, like a stack of input devices.  Those ifdefs would basically
disappear, and the history of input devices (let's say the individual
decapsulation layers for tunneling, ...) would be visible via some
common structure that could also be used by bridging.  You can ignore
that comment/rant, it has no practical relevance in the current
discussion ;)

I'm not sure if I can follow you.  What basically happens is:

ebt_ulog calls nf_log_packet(PF_BRIDGE, hooknr, skb, in, out, ...) where
"in" and "out" are struct net_device as passed to the ebt_ulog function
(which is part of the ebt_watcher). =20

[...]

the code ends up at the function you are quoting above.  "indev"
is "in" and "outdev" is "out", transparently passed from
nf_log_packet().

So I think it should reflect exactly what you currently do in ebt_ulog.
The only diference is that you now get the ifindex and not the device
name string.

Cheers,
	Harald
