This was tested by adding rules with different targets that had both
aliases defined and those without.

 ./iptables/xtables-multi main4 -t raw -N foo
 ./iptables/xtables-multi main4 -t raw -A foo -j NOTRACK
 with kernels that had xt_CT and no xt_CT at all

 ./iptables/xtables-multi main4 -N foo
 ./iptables/xtables-multi main4 -A foo -m state --state NEW
 with kernels that had xt_conntrack.3, and xt_conntrack.3 removed
 (leaving only xt_conntrack.2)

 ./iptables/xtables-multi main4 -t raw -N bar
 ./iptables/xtables-multi main4 -t raw -A bar -j MARK --set-xmark 1
 ./iptables/xtables-multi main4 -t raw -A foo -j bar

plus of course the "standard" (no pun intended) testsuite that we
had so far:

 # ./iptables/xtables-multi restore6 tests/options-most.rules 
 WARNING: --localtz is being replaced by --kerneltz, since "local" is ambiguous.
 Note the kernel timezone has caveats - see manpage for details.

As you spotted, options-most.rules did not include -j <verdict>.

While v1.4.16-1-g2aaa7ec fixes -j verdict, it breaks NOTRACK in all
instances. To reuse a line, "you'll have to explain me how you have
tested this."

A patch to what I think should fly is posted as a reply hereto.
Please give that a spin.
