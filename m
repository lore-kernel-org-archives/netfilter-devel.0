That point of the mount to hold a persistent reference to the
namespace without using a process.

The point of the of the to be written set_ns call is to change
the default network namespace of the process such that all future
open/bind/socket calls happen in the referenced network namespace.

The are a few stray places like sysfs where it is the mount point
not current->nsproxy->net_ns that will determine what we see.

Attributes of the specific namespace?
