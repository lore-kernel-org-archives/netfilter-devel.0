When did that code go in?

Although the patch does look innocent,
actually it may break a lot of things since that code is particulary
tricky and the patch changes the environmental rules. It needs study.
since it doesnt add anything other than cosmetics, holding on it
might be the wisest thing.

Seems to me the interest is more having single point for stats
collection.
Let me think about it for a bit and get back to you guys.

Didnt know that ;-> Is it in released kernels already?
Actually that patch should be fine.

Let me think about it and get back to you. Solution to #2 should apply
here.
