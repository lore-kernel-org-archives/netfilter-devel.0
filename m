That flag combination does not make sense to me. Valid combinations are:

NLM_F_REQUEST|NLM_F_CREATE : if it does not exist, create it, if it
exists, update it.
NLM_F_REQUEST|NLM_F_CREATE|NLM_F_EXCL: if it does not exist, create it,
if it exists, return -EEXIST.
NLM_F_REQUEST|NLM_F_REPLACE: if it does not exist, return -ENOENT, if it
exists, replace it.
