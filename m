So the problem is eg.
CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_REDIRECT=y
CONFIG_NF_NAT_IPV4=n

which yields
undefined reference to `nf_nat_redirect_ipv4'

adding stub fixes this; we will still register a netfilter target for
ipv4 redirect, but it cannot be called ever since that target is
resticted to 'nat' table, which doesn't exist for ipv4 in the above
config.

To me it seem cleaner to put

IS_ENABLED(NF_NAT_REDIRECT_IPV4)

into xt_REDIRECT.c instead of building not-working-but-never-called
ipv4 redirect.

Pablo, if you disagree I am fine with the patch, although
the stubs should get a 'static inline' prefix to not cause sym clash
in case we ever gain another call site.
