OK, makes sense.

Just to clarify: the actual source port on a given device will be
EITHER a high-numbered port (Cisco) or 5060 (others).  I have not come
across any devices that send from a "mix" of source ports, e.g. 49xxx
for REGISTER and then 5060 for INVITE.

>From what I have seen, subsequent SIP requests from the Cisco phone
are indeed getting associated with the original connection.  My phone
is logging into two different SIP accounts, and each account seems to
use its own unique UDP source port for all control traffic (both
expecting replies on 5060).

If Netfilter adds support for three-legged connections, will the third
leg show up in the tuplehash so I don't have to track it in the "help"
structure?
