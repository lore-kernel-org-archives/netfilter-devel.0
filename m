I will send this tiny one to Dave

Yes, but I can't asume that conntrack is there.

This  is actually where next header will start if any, not the current one that is processed. 
It's not time for checking it now. The check is done before using it further down.

hp is used for next turn, but you got a point here  I'll swap them

I think the documentation need improvments :-)
Fragments  never try to use ports.
"    if (frag)
         goto noports;"

Correct me if I'm wrong here, 
If conntrack is enabled hmark don't see the packet until it is reassembled and 
in that case the fragmentation header is removed.

So, with conntrack HMARK will operate on full packets not fragments
without conntrack ports will not be used on any fragment.

The documentation needs update here, this is not crystal clear.
