Harald,

Just a guess, but if netfilter6 doesn't go through all
the extension headers, then the protocol won't look like
ICMP6 because of the router alert option.

      It can't go through the routing table. The advertisements
are only meaningful on the particular interface, whether or not
there is a route pointing output multicasts to a different
interface (which is useful frequently, but MLD packets can't
go there too).
