Me too.   I've been caught up with other things, but Patrick's suggestion of a separate module only half worked out.

Using encapsulation sockets, to get the sysrq handled in BH context works well except that there are no encapsulation sockets for IPv6.  That, for me at least was a bit of a show stopper.

In exploring this, though, I did correct one weakness in the protocol.  An opportunistic hacker could take a sysrq packet and replay it to other hosts in the LAN in the hope that they have the same password (this is a realistic weakness rather than a theoretical one).   To counter this I simply added the target IP address to the hash.

Would you like me to submit that to xt_SYSRQ anyway?   (In a couple of weeks I'm afraid, I'm out for a while.)
