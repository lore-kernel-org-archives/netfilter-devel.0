This allows an interface to belong to only one group.  I expect there are
situations where you want more.  eg you might want a group of all pptp
connections, and another group of pptp connections for a subset of users.

An alternative approach would be to extend ipset to have sets of ifindex,
although this would tie it closer to iptables, and it would be slower.
But it still gives the properties of reducing the number of iptables rules,
and allowing to change group membership without reinstalling rules.

Maybe Jozsef has designed nfset to be able to handle this already?
