If one hash slot is under attack, then there is a bug somewhere.

If we cannot avoid this, we can fallback to a secure mode at the second
retry, and take the spinlock.

Tis way, most of lookups stay lockless (one pass), and some might take
the slot lock to avoid the possibility of a loop.

I suspect a bug elsewhere, quite frankly !

We have a chain that have an end pointer that doesnt match the expected
one.
