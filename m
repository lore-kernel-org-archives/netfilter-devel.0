Of course, there are also *much* fewer mcast groups, so the saving isn't
nearly as big. But we still have some oddball code to register them all,
basically

	err = register_mc_group();
	if (err)
		goto unregister_family;

(since we have to register the family first, afaict)

sometimes a few of those back to back, and it'd be nicer on the users if
that just went away and was

	family.mcast_groups = my_groups;
	family.n_mcast_groups = ARRAY_SIZE(my_groups);
	family.ops = my_ops;
	family.n_ops = ARRAY_SIZE(my_ops);
	return genl_register_family(&family);

since nobody uses them dynamically anyway, afaict.
