Florian forwarded the patch to me. While it fixes the problem, it
is a workaround and it certainly is inelegant to do the
list_del_rcu_init() and memset up to *four* times for a single conntrack.

The correct thing IMO is to invoke the callbacks exactly once per
conntrack, either through my nf_ct_iterate_cleanup() change or through
a new iteration function for callers that don't kill conntracks. As
soon as we start generating events for NAT section cleanup this will be
needed in any case.

Unless I'm missing something, conntrack flushing is also a really rare 
operation anyways and for large tables where this might make a small
difference will take a quite large time anyway.
