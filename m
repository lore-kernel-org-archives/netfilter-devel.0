Ugh.  I'm sorry Jamal, seems I lack a sense of humor.
In any case, no offense taken.

Right, I can imagine that.

Sure, that would not be good either (perhaps even worse).

Well, thats true.  But I would not care at this point (in the 'nft
ingress breaks when tc takes over') case.

I'd first like to see what distros would do (by default, that is).

I'd prefer to not base a 'we need to support both at same time' decision
on speculation as to what some distribution might do at some point.

Anything that makes sure that tc ingress doesn't break is fine.
If that turns out to be 'two hooks' then, alas, so be it.

I'd just like some evidence first 8-)
