I think you are referring to the older method of transparent proxying.=20
Tproxy4 does not rely on conntrack. The socket is created with the=20
connection's original ports and IPs.

Without the patch, you have the same problem in __inet_put_port(). The=20
lock is taken based on the child's inet_num, but the icsk_bind_hash of=20
the socket was inherited from the parent, so it belongs to a different=20
inet_bind_hashbucket.

With the patch, inet_bind_hash refers to the inet_bind_bucket that was=20
found by searching the hash table, rather than directly inherited from=20
the parent. This means that the correct lock is chosen for the list=20
being manipulated.
