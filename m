Its a thing that might change in a future version. Not a hard fact.

You can probably change iptables to allow softirqs while processing
OUTPUT chains.

We had some attempts in the past to switch to RCU.

It failed at that time because of some RCU implementation details, but
with recent RCU changes, we might try again, and have a clean
implementation, allowing softirqs.

So your patch would need to be reverted.
