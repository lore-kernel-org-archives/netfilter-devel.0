That'll be leftover gunk on the stack.  Enabling frame pointers makes that
go away.

Networking tried to do an atomic 1-order allocation and there were no
1-order pages available in the free page pools.  It's pretty much
unavoidable, and the caller simply needs to handle it - presumably by
dropping the packet.

Its frequency can be reduced by increasing /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes.

It can be eliminated by using GFP_KERNEL.  It can be hugely reduced by
sticking to 0-order allocations.

I wouldn't worry about this unless someone is seeing a lot of them (a
significant number of packets are getting dropped)
