I'd agree with you if we *silently* dropped packets in such
situations, but unfortunately that's not the case.

The problem is that sometimes we end up returning spurious EPERM
errors to user space. Applications may (and many actually do)
interpret EPERM as "an attempt was made to perform an operation
limited to processes with appropriate privileges or to the owner of a
file or other resource" and just bail out after seeing the first
EPERM; after all, if its cause is system policy-related there is no
point in retrying. Spurious EPERM errors would break such (perfectly
compliant) applications, so the least we can do is document them
properly.
