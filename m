I think we only need to hold the reference on orig_dev. The pt_prev
pointer in skb CB can actually be removed. Other things attached to
the skb we already handle this from nf_queue to make sure they don't
vanish.

I think the refactoring is worth. Have a look at the current state of
this function. It has grown with features along time and it got many
gotos that force you travel back and forth when reading this code.

Regarding the nf_queue support at ingress, I don't see any major
technical obstacule at this moment to support this and I think that
existing programs that inspect traffic from userspace can benefit from
this feature (eg. IPS).
