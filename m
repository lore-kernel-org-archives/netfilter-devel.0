This is one of the long standing issues that we have always known
we needed to solve, but have not taken the time to do it.  Now that
the need is more real it looks about time to solve this one.

There are currently two problems.
1) A process is needed to hold a reference to the network namespace.
2) We use pids which are an awkward way of talking about network
   namespaces.

The solution I have been playing with involves.
- Using a file descriptor to refer to a network namespace.
- Using a trivial virtual filesystem to persistently hold onto
  a namespace without the need of a process.
- Have a convention of mounting the fs at something like
  /var/run/netns/<name>

That solves the naming problem, and it should allow iproute and
it's kin to have support without being closely integrated with
lxc or anything else that creates namespaces.

It is a big conversation, and it is something that has to done
right but it looks like the problem is finally real enough that
it is time to solve it.
