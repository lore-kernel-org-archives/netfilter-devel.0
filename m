Hi Stephen,

Sorry to bring you more trouble. I'm able to reproduce this 'status
0x977d977d' rx race even with a 100Mb FD connection (MTU 1500) to the
host sending the data.

Would it help if I try and capture some packet stats or a dump of
this? The packets being received at the sending host will be a steady
stream of TCP acks and SMB protocol acks (every 64KB of data), so not
too heavy. The sending host has a Pentium-M 1.7GHz with 2MB L2$ and is
quiescent apart from samba sending data via sendfile(), so is
relatively powerful.

Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.

Many thanks,
  Daniel
