Applied both patches, but the first had serious offsets
and the second had to be applied by hand due to rejects
against the current 2.6.x sources.

Ummm... wow what ancient tree did you patch against
Harald?  The tree you patched against didn't even have the
skb_header_pointer() changes in it, that's caveman
era :-)  That's what caused the rejects.

Anyways, I merged it all in cleanly.

Thanks.
