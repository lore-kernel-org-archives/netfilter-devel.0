Dear Tejun,

how do you think, which defaults should be used for per-namespace settings in general case
and for per-netns sysctls especially? Do we have some common position about this or
perhaps we already have some setting that allows to select desired behavior?

I'm preparing patch that makes per-netns sysctls in br_netfilter,
to be able to enable/disable br-nf-call processing in each network namespace independently.

I've initialized sysctl values in each netns by system defaults, like it was done in similar cases.
However Bart pointed that "this does introduce a bit of backwards incompatibility":
currently all netns shares the br_netfilter sysctl settings applied in init_net.

>From OpenVz point of view containers should be properly isolated,
should have predictable initial configuration
and should not depend on settings applied in another containers.
On the other hand independent containers is only one of possible usecases,
and I have no strong objections against Bart's proposal. Frankly speaking
initially I've planned to copy setting from init_net too.

To make possible both variants I can introduce one more setting,
it allows to specify desired behavior:
to use system defaults or to copy current settings from init_net.

However probably the same dilemma was observed in another subsystems?
Perhaps this selector already exists?

If isn't, how do you think, should I introduce some new global parameter,
or may be it should be some local bridge-only-related setting?

Thank you,
	Vasily Averin
