For firewall mark based policy routing to work, one must still disable 
rp_filter, because this lookup doesn't take the mark into account[1].

So this statement is not quite true, although I believe you are probably right 
for this case.

BTW: This rp_filter=0 requirement isn't even officially documented 
	(e.g. in the LARTC).
