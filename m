you need to have user space knowledgeable of the mapping between an
ifindex and a zone. It may work with perhaps that info explicitly in
config with tunnel mode/ESP.

I think in general, it would be hard to deal with anything that requires
dynamic control where one or more peers have to discover each other once
you have IP overlap. You will have to change those user space apps.

In any case, for what you seem to intend this for, i think it works.

The mechanics are not there, yet. But if i had sufficient permission,
and was able to find the namespaces when i ask and/or get events when it
is created it should be an issue of sending it a message.
The current approach to say migrate a veth via iproute2 requires we 
know the pid of the target namespace. Thats a usability issue.
I tried to muck with namespaces and if you use a library like lxc
you can do it - but it is a hack as it stands today (and merging
iproute2 with lxc is questionable).

That is substantial if you are doing an embedded device.
But otherwise, RAM is so cheap that i would take usability
any day for an extra $5.

BTW, I think the zones approach will still use more than 10MB
in this case given it encompasses all "zones" whereas namespace only
does it for a single mapped "zone".

Ok, so computation is not a differentiator.

Makes sense 
On a side note: I wouldnt mind seeing some field in struct
netdev for some general purpose grouping/IDing which could be
set from user space. 

cheers,
