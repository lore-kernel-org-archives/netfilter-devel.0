But printing this does not provide any useful information. The first
packet that does not belong to the cluster node that has received the
packet, or the first invalid packet, will trigger this.

Moreover, this confuses users since they can do nothing if they receive
this message.

Moreover, this target should be supersedes by the cluster match, which
has been there for quite some time (it's also more flexible).
