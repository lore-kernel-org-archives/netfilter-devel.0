Its basically the same, except that this patch uses ct_extend
and mark values.

Routing already works fine. I believe IPsec should also work already,
but I haven't tried it.

The zone is set based on some other criteria (in this case the
incoming device). The packets make one pass through the stack
to a veth device and are SNATed in POSTROUTING to non-clashing
addresses. When they come out of the other side of the veth
device, they make a second pass through the network stack and
can be handled like any other packet.

So the setup would be (with 10.0.0.0/24 on if0 and if1):

ip rule add from if0 lookup t0
ip route add default veth0 table t0
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o veth0 -j NETMAP --to 10.1.0.0/24
echo 1 >/sys/class/net/if0/nf_ct_zone
echo 1 >/sys/class/net/veth0/nf_ct_zone

ip rule add from if1 lookup t1
ip route add default veth2 table t0
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o veth2 -j NETMARK --to 10.1.1.0/24
etho 2 >/sys/class/net/if1/nf_ct_zone
echo 2 >/sys/class/net/veth2/nf_ct_zone

The mapped packets are received on veth1 and veth3 with non-clashing
addresses.

I don't understand the problem.

I don't think thats true. In any case its completely impractical
to modify every userspace tool that does something with networking
and potentially make complex configuration changes to have all
those namespaces interact nicely. Currently they are simply not
very well suited for virtualizing selected parts of networking.

I said code size increases by 152b.

I'm not sure whether there is a typical user for overlapping
networks :) I know of setups with ~150 overlapping networks.

The number of conntracks per zone doesn't matter since the
table is shared between all zones. network namespaces would
allocate 150 tables, each of the same size, which might be
quite large.

There's not a lot of complexity, its basically passing a numeric
identifier around in a few spots and comparing it. Something like
TOS handling in the routing code.

I've thought about that and I don't think that's necessary for this
use case. Its enough to resolve overlapping address ranges, everything
else can be done in the second path through the stack.

Because people are already using it for different purposes.
