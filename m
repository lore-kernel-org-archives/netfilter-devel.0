A driver could do this, by putting all receive SKB data into
pages.

I am not aware of any that currently do this.

Such a driver would have to be very careful, as things like
the ethernet header parsing code on receive is not ready
for such things.  Things like pskb_may_pull() calls would
need to be added to that code for this to work.
