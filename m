Those got introduced to avoid the linearization. SIP is kind of special
because its the only helper mangling packets multiple times with
variable sizes and is currently unable to use the data copying scheme.
Amanda does this as well, but uses the string search API, which works
fine.

The best fix to get rid of the copying in other helpers would be to
convert them to the string search API. I started doing that a few
years ago, but never finished it. One related improvement we could
add would be to make only those parts of the skb writable that are
actually written to when mangling packets, at least for non-linear
non-paged skbs (using frag_list).
