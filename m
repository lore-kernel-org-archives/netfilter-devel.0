Sorry for the late response. Wanted to do some more testing before
replying.

My assumptions regarding macvlan were wrong:

A) The code my patch adds is not touched in the case of a macvlan
device on top of a bridge - with macvlan there seems to be no FDB entry
for the MAC address of the macvlan device at all, actually, resulting
in the flooding of a frame intended for that device (is this, ehm,
known/intended?).

B) ip_rcv() does not drop for a macvlan device, because macvlan
unconditionally sets skb->pkt_type to PACKET_HOST in macvlan_handle_frame().

(And I guess, maybe I shouldn't actually care that much about
macvlans on top of a bridge, as a veth-pair is much cleaner for that?)


Regarding netdev::dev_addrs, if I understand the kernel code correctly, it
is only, potentially populated with more than netdev::dev_addr for two
drivers, via dev_addr_add(): bnx2x and ixgbe. So for a bridge device,
there should never be more than one item in netdev::dev_addrs
(= netdev::dev_addr), correct?


So, currently I'm happy with moving the fix into the ebtables dnat
code and just checking against the netdev::dev_addr of the bridge
device now. (if anyone has any suggestions regarding upper devices
I should test with that, then please let me know)

(Sorry, Pablo, for me pressing against your earlier suggestion to
put the fix in the ebtables dnat instead of bridge code. :( )

Regards, Linus
