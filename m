I've made a new version of the patch which I'll be able to test
tonight.

Agreed. The added MSS is likely to be larger than 536 too... I've
removed this code.

I was referring to the SYN packet itself. It wouldn't always be
possible to add an option without exceeding the MTU of that packet's
destination if it had data.

Except to remove the printk which fills up my serial console (because
the header offset is wrong).
