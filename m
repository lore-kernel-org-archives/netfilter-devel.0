Ah so I should have realized before but I wasn't looking at valid values
for the range of the hashtable yet, nf_conntrack_htable_size is getting
wildly out of whack. It goes from:

(gdb) print nf_conntrack_hash_rnd
$1 = 2688505299
(gdb) print nf_conntrack_htable_size
$2 = 16384

nf_conntrack_events: 1
nf_conntrack_max: 65536

Shortly after booting, before being NULLed shortly after starting some
virtual machines (the hash isn't reset, whereas it is recomputed if the
hashtable is re-initialized after an intentional resizing operation):

(gdb) print nf_conntrack_hash_rnd
$3 = 2688505299
(gdb) print nf_conntrack_htable_size
$4 = 0

nf_conntrack_events: 1
nf_conntrack_max: 0
nf_conntrack_buckets: 0

Then when I start the third virtual machine:

(gdb) print nf_conntrack_hash_rnd
$15 = 2688505299
(gdb) print nf_conntrack_htable_size
$16 = 2180904176

And we're done. Which is great. But I don't think it's random corruption
since it's reproducible by a number of people on different hardware. So
hopefully for some reason this is being deliberately screwified.

Jon.
