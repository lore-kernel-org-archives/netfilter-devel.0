GRE, FOU, GUE in case of sk_mc_loop and the destination is a multicast
address, we imply sk_mc_loop() == true, what is not what we want. Tunnel
sockets deliberately set mc_loop to false but we cannot adhere to them,
yet. David's patchset changes that.

Also, I saw one inconsistency with sk_bound_dev_if in netfilter which
doesn't get solved by this patchset (it uses skb->sk->sk_bound_dev_if
unconditionally).

I think that having a struct-sock carrying over meta-information is a
good thing.

Thanks,
Hannes
