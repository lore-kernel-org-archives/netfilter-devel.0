As far as I can see not repeating sequences like that is fundamental
for making this work at all.  Just because only the audit subsystem
should know about one or multiple audit daemons.  Nothing else should
care.

So I think there are two parts of this answer.  Assuming we are talking
about nesting audit daemons in containers we will have different
rulesets and I expect most of the events for a nested audit daemon won't
be of interest to the outer audit daemon.

Beyond that it should be very straight forward to keep a pointer and
leave the buffer as a scatter gather list until audit_log_end
and translate pids, and rewrite ACIDs attributes in audit_log_end
when we build the final packet.  Either through collaboration with
audit_log_format or a special audit_log command that carefully sets
up the handful of things that need that information.

Hmm.  I am seeing that we send skbs to kauditd and then kauditd
sends those skbs to userspace.  I presume that is primary so that
sending messages to userspace does not block the process being audited.

Plus a little bit so that the retry logic will work.

I think the naive implementation would be to simply have 1 kauditd
per auditd (strictly and audit context/namespace).  Although that can be
optimized if that is a problem.

Beyond that I think we would need to look at profiles to really
understand where the bottlenecks are.

I think we just a very limited amount of structs/TLVs for the cases that
matter and one-one auditd and kauditd implementations we should still
be able to do everything in audit_log_end.  Plus doing as much work as
possible in audit_log_end where things are still cache hot is desirable.

It definitely makes sense to look ahead to having audit daemons running
in containers, but in the grand scheme of things that is a nice to have.
Probably something we will and should get to, but we have lived a long
time without auditd running in containers so I expect we can live a
while longer.

As I understand Richard patchset for the specific case of the ACID we
are only talking about taking a subset of an existing string, and one
string at that.  Not hard at all.  Especially when looking at the
fundamental fact that we will need to send a different skb to
userspace, for each audit daemon.
