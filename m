Okay, you have convinced me. :) I studied connmark a bit more and now I
realize that it won't take more CPU.  In the solution with connmark that
you proposed the packets coming from a connection that is already marked
will be quickly returned to normal processing, so it will be fairly
efficient and certainly not more CPU hungry than the NFNOTIF.

I have to admit that you're right here again.  I think that it will not
be necessary to make this change in the NFLOG, since the connmark
solution is actually pretty clear too.  If needed, I'll make this simple
change in the NFLOG module and submit.

Thanks for your help.
