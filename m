Thanks for this hint, however this is not selecting a source address for
a given destination, rather it selects the address where tproxy is
redirecting the connection in case the user specified no --on-ip
parameter.

e.g. 

ip6tables -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j TPROXY --on-port 50080

This should redirect the connection to the primary IP address of the
incoming interface. In fact I spent 2 hours to figure out how to find
the proper address, and at the end I used the first IP address
configured to the interface, seeing that those addresses are sorted in
'scope' order, e.g. link-local and site-local addresses are at the end
of the list, thus the front should be ok.

Since I'm not that much into IPv6, I'd appreciate some help, is
ipv6_dev_get_saddr(client_ip_address) indeed the best solution here?
