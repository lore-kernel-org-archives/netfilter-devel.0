I think this makes a lot of sense for nfnetlink_queue/log, I'll
gladly take patches :) It should also support changing the priority
using nfnetlink_queue, that would simplify userspace classification
since you don't need to map to mark values, just to have the
classifier map it back to classes.

For libpcap the main problem will probably be that its meta data
that needs to be stored in the pseudo header and you'll need to
keep the format compatible and the tools need to be changed to
interpret it. Using netfilter definitely looks like the easier
route :)
