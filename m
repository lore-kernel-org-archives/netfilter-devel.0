Are you Ok with getting patch 1 merged while be discuss
what to do about the issue that the second patch tried to
document? Could I get your "Acked-by" for it?

The problem is that there is a huge installed base of
systems that show this broken behaviour, so even if
we find a proper fix for it we still should document
which systems may be affected by the spurious EPERM
bug, thus giving application programmers a chance to
add logic to their programs to recover from such
eventualities.

Fernando
