Yes. something like:
struct sk_filter {
        atomic_t refcnt;
        struct rcu_head rcu;
        u32 filter_size;
        struct bpf_prog *prog;
};
filter_size also makes sense to add right now to cleanup charging.

of course, that was never the intent.
all socket related stuff should keep sk_* prefix and stay in net/
only net-independent things makes sense to move.

yes. exactly.

btw, Dave may request to do a fresh repost of both of your
patches with v2 tag... Alternatively I can do rebase + fix what we
discussed above + split and repost yours and mine as single
series, since they're addressing one area...
Also I want to do some more testing of your #2 patch for seccomp
to make sure all is clean.
