Reading again your patch, I understand only the Changelog is wrong.

We want to copy quota back to userspace, as specified when rule was
setup (so that iptables-save works)

The real thing you are doing is that we dont change the initial quota
during packet processing, only the private quota, shared by all cpus.

Before the patch , iptables -nvL could report an old and not accurate
quota value.

After the patch, iptables -nvL reports the initial quota value, not the
actual value.
