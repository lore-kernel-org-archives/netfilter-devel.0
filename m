The configuration is per net_cls ID, and with a cgroup manager that
assigns unique IDs to each application/service/task, this effectively
becomes a per-application setting (or anything else for that matter, see
below).

Ok, so the term is misleading, I agree. I am talking about a possibility
for userspace to install netfilter rules that match packets sent to or
sent by a task, or a set of tasks (you may call that an application or
service).

So for example, I want a way to redirect netfilter decisions that are
about tasks in net_cls cgroup 23 to a dedicated chain, so the admin can
configure rules that only apply to a certain service or application.

Sure, but why is that a problem exactly? I still don't understand your
technical concerns.

In that case, the receiver socket would be the one of that
userspace-driven TCP stack, and the same rules apply. The feature might
not make much sense in such setups though, but that's not an issue.

cgroups are the most comprehensive notion the kernel has about a group
of tasks, which may be called a service or an application. By allowing
users to make netfilter rules specific to a setting in a cgroup
controller, we open the doors for supporting a lot of interesting use
cases. Which tasks to put into a cgroup with a certain net_cls setting
is up to userspace, but it would be possible to group everything the OS
considers an 'application'.

That's a matter of explaining that fact in the documentation, I'd say :)

In a sense, what happens is comparable to rules that are specific to an
ingress interface. Depending on whether that interface is up or down,
these netfilter rules are iterated or they aren't, right?

Anyway, note that socket uid/gid and cgroup matches already exist for
ingress today, so the exact same change in behavior that you describe is
in place since a number of releases. It's just that right now, what the
kernel does is to only match packets that had early demux treatment,
which makes it largely unusable for users. So, what this patch set aims
for is to make an existing feature actually usable.

I'm open to other approaches, as long as it allows us to install
netfilter rules that match against net_cls IDs. The demux target would
probably be another option, but I'm not convinced yet that would be any
better from a technical perspective.

Pablo, what do you think?



Thanks,
Daniel
