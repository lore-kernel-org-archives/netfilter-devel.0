Yes, I think I'll use the /sys/device/virtual/misc class.  That seems to
be the place where, well, miscellaneous devices go. :) I think it fits
pretty nicely in that concept.

We could also have a /sys/net subsystem, but that's very high in the
sysfs hierarchy and adding it in the xt_IDLETIMER module wouldn't make
any sense.  This is something that should be added (if really needed) in
the net core subsystem, I guess.

I'll use the first option and resubmit the patch as v3.
