No it is working pretty well, because conn_in_get() is fragment aware.
if cp is null it's a new connection and in that case only the first frag will do
a schedule.
For the following fragments reasm will be used by conn_in_get()
so it should normaly return a valid "cp".

OK no problems.

Well in the case when you have the VIP at the loopback that is true.
If you have rules based on fw mark that force packets to IPVS,
you will miss all fragments, i.e. the will go to the FORWARD chain

So that is why skb_dst_copy() is needed.

That's a side effect. 
But I'm working on a solution for ip6tables to keep track on the fragments
most people isn't aware of that you must take care of fragemnts your self 
in your ip6tables rule-set....

Good idea, thanks !!!
I'll will do that

It doesn't work if you don't have the VIP on the lo.

OK, I will check this once again with VIP at lo

Actually it's the input routing that is important

no VIP on lo.

Yes in xnat_handler(..)

#ifdef CONFIG_IP_VS_IPV6
	if (cp->af == AF_INET6 && iph->fragoffs)
		return 1;
#endif

Yes, (but we have them in reasm)

BTW, I have not test ESP & AH but on the other hand the are not subjects for fragmentation.
The sending of ICMPV6_PKT_TOOBIG seems to be generic so...
