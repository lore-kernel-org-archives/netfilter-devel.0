Looking at your incomplete .config, I don't see how you set xt_TPROXY
and xt_socket but I bet they are =y.

For the udp6_lib_lookup dependency, you can use the ipv6 hooks added
here:

    netfilter: add nf_ipv6_ops hook to fix xt_addrtype with IPv6

Already in the nf tree, to resolve it. It would be fairly easy to make
a patch for it.

For the nf_defrag_ipv6_enable, as I already mentioned, that's an
artificial function to enforce the dependency between those two
modules. We can add runtime checks in socket and TPROXY to skip
further processing is nf_defrag_ipv6 is not loaded. But that's a
problem because users will assume that their socket/TPROXY rule got
loaded but it will not actually work since defrag is not loaded.  I
think that really needs some Kconfig tricks for that specific case.

Regards.
