I'm curious, but doesn't the fact that registered 'barrier' callback is
invoked mean grace period completion? I.e. why to bother with
rescheduling, waiting for thread to complete and so on, when we only
care in the fact that 'barrier' callback is invoked, and thus all
previous ones are completed?
Or it is done just for the simplicity, since all rescheduling machinery
already manages the rcu bits correctly, so you do not want to put it
directly into 'barrier' callback?
