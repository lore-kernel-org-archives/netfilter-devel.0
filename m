Hi,

Could you please describe the solution you implemented a bit more? There was 
just so many back and forth that I'm confused now.

If I use it with iptables, do the transport mode packets go through INPUT and 
OUTPUT twice, decrypted and encrypted?

If I use it with iptables, do the tunnel mode packets go through FORWARD or 
INPUT and OUTPUT twice, decrypted and encrypted?

Can I do NAT in tunnel and transport mode?

what about the policy match patches, why are they only posted "for 
completeness" and as 11/12 of 10? Aren't they ready yet?

Thanks for enlightment.

Kind regards,

Gerd
