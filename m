I've spent part of the evening testing this and checking its
possibilities, the drawbacks that I see for this contribution are:

* it uses the /proc entry, we have rejected similar add-ons in the
  past that have used these interfaces.
* one single reader can be reading at a time.

Having said that, I still think that the feature that this provides
is useful, but I think that implementing this in user-space over
nfnetlink_log results in a much more flexible solution.

I have made proof-of-concept daemon (it's a quick hack of several
hours) that implements the similar feature over nfnetlink_log,
advantages are:

* You don't need to upgrade your kernel / iptables.
* You only need to install libnfnetlink, libnetfilter_log and the
  daemon.
* It can be extended to support multiple readers.

So my conclusion is that you can make this in userspace in a much more
flexible way.

The initial commit provides some description on how to use it:

I don't plan to develop / maintain that software. The last thing I
want in my todo list is yet another thing to maintain. If someone is
interested, please, feel free to grab it, make a nice website for it
and maintain it.

The repository also contains an unfinished patch to add LOG format
support to libnetfilter_log.
