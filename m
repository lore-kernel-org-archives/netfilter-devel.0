Why cant you use the same interface that exists today - the one that is
used to load new filter rules?

Sure. It will be nice to have something like that in user space.

Refer to my comment above: I dont think you need anything new. Look at a
simple classifier like fwmark and comment if you need something new.

Please think about that problem - otherwise you get an C in your course
work from me ;-> (F would be too harsh ;->)

I think it is nice to have a feature that does the verification in
user space before downloading.  
I didnt understand what you mean that someone else writes their own
"client/compiler". Arent you the one in charge of this compiler?
Why would you allow other people to write this compiler?
