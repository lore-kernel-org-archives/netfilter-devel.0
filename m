Thinking about this again, I'm not sure that I agree.

OK, I don't actually care whether we process it once or twice for
pure transport mode, but I think that it is absolutely essential
that LOCAL_IN/LOCAL_OUT see the decapsulated packet instead of
the encrypted version.

Whether it's IPv4 or IPv6, transport mode shouldn't make you lose the
ability to use netfilter to filter out packets.

Now if we can achieve this by sending the packet through netfilter
only once then I'm all for it.

But if for whatever reason we can't do that, then I'd rather have it
go through twice than not see the decapsulated packet at all which is
the case at the moment.

Cheers,
