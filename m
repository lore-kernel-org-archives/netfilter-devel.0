From: Hangbin Liu <liuhangbin@gmail.com>

Fix sync_threshold description which should have two values. Also add
sync_refresh_period and sync_retries based on commit 749c42b620a9
("ipvs: reduce sync rate with time thresholds").

+	It sets synchronization threshold, which is the minimum number

+	modulus sync_period equals the threshold. The range of the

+sync_refresh_period - UNSIGNED INTEGER
+	default 0
+
+	In seconds, difference in reported connection timer that triggers
+	new sync message. It can be used to avoid sync messages for the
+	specified period (or half of the connection timeout if it is lower)
+	if connection state is not changed since last sync.
+
+	This is useful for normal connections with high traffic to reduce
+	sync rate. Additionally, retry sync_retries times with period of
+	sync_refresh_period/8.
+
+sync_retries - INTEGER
+	default 0
+
+	Defines sync retries with period of sync_refresh_period/8. Useful
+	to protect against loss of sync messages. The range of the
