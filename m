__nf_conntrack_confirm() is only called for the first packet that we
see in a flow. If you just invoked the flush command once (which
should be the common case), then this is likely to be the first packet
of the flow (unless you already called flush anytime soon in the
past).

I understand your original motivation was to be conservative.

The general policy in conntrack is to not drop packets, but in this
case we'll leave things in inconsistent state (ie. we will likely
receive a reply packet in response to the original packet that has no
conntrack yet).

Thanks.
