I don't think ipv6_skip_exthdr() is too weight. If there isn't any
extra header, only some compare and jump instruments are added, and no
more data references. If there are some headers, I think distributing
packets among CPUs is more important than the extra cost introduced by
calling ipv6_skip_exthdr().

Maybe they don't know it.If it was a performance regression, I think
more people might pay attention on it.
