Hello, Daniel:
   can all your examples block early before doing network operations? What's the whole netfilter universe? Can you give us more clear examples?

Thanks

I gave one simple example for blocking in the commit message, that's true, but it is not limited to that, meaning we can have much different scenarios/policies that netfilter allows us than just blocking, e.g. fine grained settings where applications are allowed to connect/send traffic to, application traffic marking/ conntracking, application-specific packet mangling, and so on, just think of the whole netfilter universe.
