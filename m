I'm not sure we should anticipate bad networking setups like that.
Probably ipvs wouldn't be the only one to suffer from such bad config.

Anyway, then we should include that sysctl together with that min(),
because otherwise it will be impossible to send packets larger than
1500 and this may be a regression to some users. Or maybe you don't
think that large packets are worth for the sync at all?

Thanks,
Marcelo
