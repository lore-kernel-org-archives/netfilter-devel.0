Sorry but I don't follow this one. You mean having the check on 
nf_log_register() and then calling a __nf_log_register() to actually register it?

Now I'm thinking on wrapping
             rcu_dereference_protected(loggers[i][logger->type],
+					lockdep_is_held(&nf_log_mutex))
into a macro or something like that, because that's the issue in there and 
this construction is called several times. Something like:

#define logger_deref_protected(pf, type) \
         rcu_dereference_protected(loggers[pf][type], \
                                   lockdep_is_held(&nf_log_mutex));

WDYT?

Sure. It was taken from nfnetlink_log_init() so I'll take the shot to update 
it too.

Yes. I'll send a v2
