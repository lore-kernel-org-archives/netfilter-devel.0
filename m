that was originally, way back.  It turned out to be a bad idea, after
all... way too complex.  At least that's how I look at it.  Too sad :(

Rusty and me then had the idea about the routing based approach at some
point, if I remember correctly.  We talked about it with Krisztian and
Balazs at least on one occasion.

All that isn't really important.  All I wanted to say was:

"I (and AFAIR the netfilter core team) believe this is the way to
implement good support for transparent proxying.  It's already the
second completely independent implementation, let's merge it after all."
