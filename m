I think its wrong to rely on "expired_count", with these
kinds of numbers (up to 10k entries are scanned per round
in Denys setup, its basically always going to be > 0.

I think we should only decide to scan more frequently if
eviction ratio is large, say, we found more than 1/4 of
entries to be stale.

I sent a small patch offlist that does just that.

Thanks, thats exactly what I was looking for.
So I am not at all surprised that gc_worker eats cpu cycles...

I agree its a bug.

Look for "nf_ct_gc_expired" and "nf_ct_delete".
Its going to be deep down in the call graph.
