Please, read the scenario, I'm not talking about conntrack this time.

Yes, I got the idea. Indeed HMARK can be very useful in other situations,
like cluster-based OSPF setups with stateful firewalls following a
similar approach.

However, you don't reply to my scenario. What I'm telling is that,
even with conntrack disabled, HMARK is not consistent if you start
receiving fragments at some point.

have a look at offsetof, you can use the existing structure but tell
skb_copy_header to copy only the part you're interested. Add a comment
telling what you're only copying part of the header to warn others (in
this case, the comment becomes useful since it clarifies something
that you may not notice at a first glance by looking at the code).

*Extremely unlikely*, I'd say :-). If you double check that hmod is
non-zero in user-space and checkentry(), we will not hit that branch
ever. Moreover, that branch is in the hot path while the others are
only configure-time paths.
