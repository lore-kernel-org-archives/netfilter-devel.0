I'm not sure if it is too late in the cycle but
if not could you please consider these fixes for v3.11?

In my opinion these all seem to be -stable candidates.
I would appreciate your opinion on that.

* Make the service replacement more robust

  This resolves a regression introduced by commit 578bc3ef1e473a
  ("ipvs: reorganize dest trash")

  This problem was introduced in 3.9

* Do not use dest after ip_vs_dest_put in LBLCR

  This resolves a regression introduced by commit c5549571f975ab

  This problem was introduced in 3.9

* Do not use dest after ip_vs_dest_put in LBLC
