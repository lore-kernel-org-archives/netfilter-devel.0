Actually, that was the approach I thought about and went for first
(and it would probably work for me). Just checking against the
bridge device's net_device::dev_addr.

I scratched it though, as I was afraid that the issue might still
exist for people using some other upper device on top of the bridge
device. For instance, macvlan? And iterating over the
net_device::dev_addrs list seemed too costly for fast path to me.
