I don't think so. I'm not sure if I understand all of IPv6 routing
correctly, but it looks like dst entries allocated by
addrconf_dst_alloc() are added to the routing table pretty much like
normal routes and skbuffs get assigned such dst entries by normal rule
lookup / route lookup.

If an skbuff got assigned such a dst entry by normal routing in the
first place, and the changes done by the mangle table don't affect
routing (e.g. skb->mark changed but no policy based routing), I guess
that rerouting the packet will get you there too. In the meantime, by
not specifying DST_NOREROUTE for such destinations, you don't lose the
capability to mangle a packet so it should really be routed
differently.

Should I post a new patch email including this comment?
