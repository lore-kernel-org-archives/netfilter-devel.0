Since conntrack cleanup is invoken from netns cleanup while
the namespace still exists, this shouldn't happen. The
conntrack cleanup doesn't return until all entries are
freed, creation of new entries is prevented by unregistering
the hooks previously, at least without namespaces. Mhh ok,
actually this can happen since the hooks don't seem to be
per namespace. In that case, making sure that all devices
from that namespace are unregistered previously should
have the same effect.
