You make it sound like you have already made up your mind and will
not consider xtnl because you are having nft as your pet project.
That would be really sad.

So, what xt2 has of this hour.

(- netlink interface obviously)
 - netns support
 - single table sufficiency
 - is RCU'd
 - atomic whole-table replace
 - atomic chain-level multi-rule replace
   (less to transfer over netlink between kernel<->user)
 - chain-level dump (also relates to transfer size)
 - packed ruleset for cache efficiency
 - already has had some review from community members when it was last posted
 - in-code and external documentation

Certainly there is still something to do - but so would there be for nft.
