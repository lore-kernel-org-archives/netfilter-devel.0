I would actually expect them to use neither TC nor nft, so the most
interesting number would be the impact if not used. Additionally I'd
like to see the numbers for moving ingress to use the netfilter hook
if it is actually used.

The costs of TC actions vs nft are actually not relevant in my
opinion since we're not replacing anything.
