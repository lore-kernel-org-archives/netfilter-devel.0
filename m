Hi David,

The following patchset contains relevant updates for the Netfilter
tree, they are:

* Enhancements for ipset: Add the counter extension for sets, this
  information can be used from the iptables set match, to change
  the matching behaviour. Jozsef required to add the extension
  infrastructure and moved the existing timeout support upon it.

* Enhancements for performance boosting in nfnetlink_queue: Add new
  configuration flags that allows user-space to receive big packets (GRO)
  and to disable checksumming calculation. This were proposed by Eric
  Dumazet during the Netfilter Workshop 2013 in Copenhagen. Florian
  Westphal was kind enough to find the time to materialize the proposal.

* A sparse fix from Simon, he noticed it in the SCTP NAT helper, the fix
  required a change in the interface of sctp_end_cksum.

Let me know if we're still in time to get this into net-next. Thanks!
