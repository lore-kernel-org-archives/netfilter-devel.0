Hi all,

When I sent this to netdev back in June, Dave pointed out how horrible
this is, since it breaks all sorts of layering. The result of that
discussion was that something like this -- the backwards
transformation and the correct rate limiting -- belongs inside
netfilter and not polluting the icmp code directly. He ended by
telling me, "I highly encourage you to continue pursuing the netfilter
based approach, and to also discuss it on netfilter-devel which will
hit more capable minds than just here on netdev." So, a few months
late, I'm forwarding this email here, in case anybody is interested.

Regards,
Jason

The ICMP routines use the source address for two reasons:

    1. Rate-limiting ICMP transmissions based on source address, so
       that one source address cannot provoke a flood of replies. If
       the source address is wrong, the rate limiting will be
       incorrectly applied.

    2. Choosing the interface and hence new source address of the
       generated ICMP packet. If the original packet source address
       is wrong, ICMP replies will be sent from the wrong source
       address, resulting in either a misdelivery, infoleak, or just
       general network admin confusion.

Most of the time, the icmp_send and icmpv6_send routines can just reach
down into the skb's IP header to determine the saddr. However, if
icmp_send or icmpv6_send is being called from a network device driver --
there are a few in the tree -- then it's possible that by the time
icmp_send or icmpv6_send looks at the packet, the packet's source
address has already been transformed by SNAT or MASQUERADE or some other
transformation that CONNTRACK knows about. In this case, the packet's
source address is most certainly the *wrong* source address to be used
for the purpose of ICMP replies.

Rather, the source address we want to use for ICMP replies is the
original one, from before the transformation occurred.

Fortunately, it's very easy to just ask CONNTRACK if it knows about this
packet, and if so, how to fix it up. The saddr is the only field in the
header we need to fix up, for the purposes of the subsequent processing
in the icmp_send and icmpv6_send functions, so we do the lookup very
early on, so that the rest of the ICMP machinery can progress as usual.
In my tests, this setup works very well.
