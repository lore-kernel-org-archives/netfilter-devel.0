I guess need_conntrack() could be moved to checkentry() and only called 
if the track flag is set.

It's more efficient this way, and simpler to manage.  

Currently, after security marking, the chain should normally terminate 
with a -j ACCEPT.  Requiring the use of CONNSECMARK to label connections 
means inserting another rule before terminating the chain.

Also, security marking for connections only occurs in the context of 
copying the security mark from packets, so there's no reason to build a 
general feature to do this into CONNSECMARK.

Another possibility would be to get rid of CONNSECMARK completely and have 
SECMARK copy security marks from connections to packets via the use of a 
different flag (perhaps change --track into --save-state and then have 
--restore-state, or similar).
