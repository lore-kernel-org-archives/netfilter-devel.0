Ive had an equivalent discussion with B Greear (CCed) at one point on
something similar, curious if you solve things differently - couldnt
tell from the patch if you address it.

Agreed that this would be a main driver of such a feature.
Which means that you need zones (or whatever noun other people use) to
work on not just netfilter, but also routing, ipsec etc.
As a digression: this is trivial to solve with network namespaces.

The fundamental question i have is:
how you deal with overlapping addresses?
i.e zone1 uses 10.0.0.1 and zone2 uses 10.0.0.1 but they are for
different NAT users/endpoints.

Unless there is a clever approach for overlapping IP addresses (my
question above), i dont see a way around essentially virtualizing the
whole stack which clone(CLONE_NEWNET) provides..

This is a valid concern against the namespace approach. Existing tools
of course could be taught to know about namespaces - and one could
argue that if you can resolve the overlap IP address issue, then you
_have to_ modify user space anyways.

Elaboration needed.
You said the size in 64 bit increases to 152B per conntrack i think?
Do you have a hand-wave figure we can use as a metric to elaborate this
point? What would a typical user of this feature have in number of
"zones" and how many contracks per zone? Actually we could also look
at extremes (huge number vs low numbers)...

You may also wanna look as a metric at code complexity/maintainability
of this scheme vs namespace (which adds zero changes to the kernel).
I am pretty sure you will soon be "zoning" on other pieces of the net
stack ;->

My opinions above.

BTW, why not use skb->mark instead of creating a new semantic construct?
