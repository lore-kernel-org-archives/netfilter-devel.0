Good point. This specific flags should be cleared when a packet
(re-)enters the IP stack, I guess by definition of the cb, this
holds for the other flags as well. Looking at the other flags:

- IPSKB_MASQUERADED is unused
- IPSKB_TRANSLATED is unused
- IPSKB_FORWARDED is used by ipmr in a way that looks broken,
   it expects the flags on the input path to be the same it set
   on the output path.
- IPSKB_XFRM_TUNNEL_SIZE should be cleared when a packet enters
   the IP stack

It seems in most places where only IPCB(skb)->opt is cleared
the entire CB should be cleared. A couple of spots also look
completely unnecessary, for example all places clearing the CB
before passing the packet to netif_rx. I would expect the next
user beeing responsible for clearing the space he needs if
neccessary.
