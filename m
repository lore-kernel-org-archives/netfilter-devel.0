It is the call_rcu() in nf_conntrack_expect.c (which is linked into
nf_conntrack.ko).  But that also means that it should have been the slab
cache called "nf_ct_expect_cachep" we should have waited for... (and I
also notice that "nf_ct_expect_cachep" is missing the
SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU flag, and the SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU flag should be
removed from "nf_conntrack_cachep")

Just dived into the slab.c code and noticed that it also is flawed,
ARGH!.  When the SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU flags is set, it only calls
synchronize_rcu() and not rcu_barrier() as it should!

I'll fix that up in another patch series... 

Looking into slub and slob at the moment, and it seems that they
schedule another call_rcu callback for freeing when the
SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU flags is set.  That seems racy to me... Paul?

Fine!

This call_rcu() is the one done in nf_conntrack_extend.c:114  (notice
"_extend" NOT "_expect"), which calls __nf_ct_ext_free_rcu().

Guess this rcu_barrier() should then be move to
nf_ct_extend_unregister() right? (it already invokes a
synchronize_rcu() that should be replaced by rcu_barrier()).
Although this means the nf_ct_extend_unregister() will be called three
times in nf_conntrack_cleanup_net() when unregistering ecache, acct and
expect.


Thank you for your feedback :-) ... I'll post a new v2 patch...
