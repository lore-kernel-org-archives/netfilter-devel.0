Yes, the addresses are sorted by scope, but just because they're in the
list doesn't mean they can be used, for example that address might have
failed DAD or be Deprecated.  ipv6_dev_get_saddr() will follow the rules
from RFC 3484 in picking the best address to use, or none if there isn't
anything appropriate.

Probably.  An alternative might be to use ip6_dst_lookup() (see tcp_v6_connect()),
but a lot more code for you.
