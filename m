I can't help feeling that it might be better to have a spin_lock_sync()
call that is equivalent to a spin_lock/spin_unlock pair.
The default implementation being an inline function that does exactly that.
This would let an architecture implement a more efficient version.

It might even be that this is the defined semantics of spin_unlock_wait().

Note that it can only be useful to do a spin_lock/unlock pair if it is
impossible for another code path to try to acquire the lock.
(Or, at least, the code can't care if the lock is acquired just after.)
So if it can de determined that the lock isn't held (a READ_ONCE()
might be enough) the lock itself need not be acquired (with the
associated slow bus cycles).
