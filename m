I think technicaly it's still held using processes, only now it's
much more indirect:

netns <- mount <- mount namespace(s) <- process(es)

The big difference is we'd be waiting for all the processes
sharing that mount (or dups of it in multiple mount namespaces) to
exit too -- not just those sharing the netns.

Using a mount requires keeping names for the namespaces themselves
in the kernel which is a problem we've largely avoided so far.
The nscgroup is an example of the messes that creates, I think. And it
further complicates c/r -- we'd need to checkpoint and recreate the
names of the namespaces too. So we'll need a namespace for the names of
the namespaces to make restart reliable won't we? Makes my head spin...

Cheers,
