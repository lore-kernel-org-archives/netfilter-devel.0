On the danger of repeating myself, every (converted) user requires
that we at least keep the existing semantics since it is exposed to
userspace. My opinion is that NLM_F_DUMP_INTR is fine if userspace
indicates support, but without that, we have to take care of that
in the kernel.

An automatic restart handles this well. Userspace always had to
expect duplicates.
