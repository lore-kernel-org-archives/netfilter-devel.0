Yes!

Let's ask Den about this particular patch, though. :-)

We discussed this in "unlock iptables in netns" thread
http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&m=121311890005554&w=2

With this patchset conntracking and NAT are largely netns-ready (I hope),
the list shrinks.

	ebtable_filter
	ebtable_nat
	selinux
	decnet
	IPv6 REJECT
	+ several individual matches/etc 

As for other stuff,
	conntrack statistics (trivial)
	ctnetlink (stubbed to init_net, dunno what it is)
	NF_LOG, NF_QUEUE (deprecated? don't bother at all?)



grep init_net -w -n -r net/netfilter/ net/ipv4/netfilter/ net/ipv6/netfilter/
shows more or less what works, and what doesn't.
