Let's forget about this other proposal.  It's not going to be efficient
at all.  It's worse than I thought at first, because we need search all
the associated_ifs in all timers whenever a packet is received.

I'll go for the other solution, which will make things much simpler and
I'll be able to remove the dependency on netdevice_notifiers
completely. :D
