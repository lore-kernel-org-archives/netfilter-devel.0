Good point.

Yes, the nfnetlink_queue module calls nf_unregister_queue_handler()
in the module fini method before it does anything else.  That does
set queue_handler to NULL and calls synchronize_rcu() before anything
else.

So in practice that is not a problem, but being disconnected from
everything else that is not immediately apparent.  Sigh.

Ouch.  That is a little scary.  Today we only have remove_proc_entry
in nfnl_queue_net_exit.  If we had something more substantial those
calls after .exit (without my change) we could get into nasty to find
oopses.  So I guess I did prevent a possible future issue with my patch.


I am half wondering if we could make everything simpler by simply not
allowing nfnetlink_queue be a module.
