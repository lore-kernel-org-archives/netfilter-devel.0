No, my question is does it ever make sense to use conntrack as
part of bridge netfilter.  That is, do you ever want to test it
in your rules that are run as part of bridge netfilter.

conntrack is inherently a security hole when used as part of
bridging, because it ignores the Ethernet header so two unrelated
connections can be tracked as one.

It used to be an even bigger security hole when we ignored VLAN
and PPPOE headers but at least that's now off by default.

Cheers,
