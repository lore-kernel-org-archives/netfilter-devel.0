Not sure this is needed.  Patrick added support for a per-bridge
sysfs flag a while back.

Yes, well... I am afraid Patrick is right, we cannot remove it without
breaking some setups.

So, what to do?

I think the first step would be to go ahead and split the hook glue to
a separate module, and then add the autoprobing from the packet processing
path (only loading br_nf module when needed).

We could still add a deprecation warning later on (aka 'please modprobe
br_nf_core' instead).  But yes, Patricks probably right, waiting two
years doesn't make it more 'safe' than waiting 6 months...

What _might_ help is if there was an easy (and fast) way to tell wheter
iptables rules are loaded (right now it checks for active netfilter hooks).

Then, we could restrict the autoload to arp/ip(6)tables and not load
the br_nf glue module when nft is used instead.

That will allow removing autload with iptables removal.  Yes, I know
this is in a very distant future...
