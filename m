Agreed, this looks just like messing around with naming to me.

But to the original issue, that of xt_bpf, I wonder about a few things:

1) If we have a kernel pointer embedded in a user provided datastructure,
   what takes care of 32-bit compat applications uploading xt_bpf rules
   on a 64-bit kernel?  Won't the size be wrong or does it not matter
   and is in some way helped by that 8-byte alignment thing there?

2) The user can't care about the type of "filter" in xt_bpf_info, so
   we can use whatever name we want for the type.

   Therefore you can just do something like:


struct bpf_prog;

struct xt_bpf_info {
	__u16 bpf_program_num_elem;
	struct sock_filter bpf_program[XT_BPF_MAX_NUM_INSTR];

	/* only used in the kernel */
	struct bpf_prog *filter __attribute__((aligned(8)));
};

   and then you won't need any casting.
