Ingress filtering to implement distribtued packet filters is very
relevant for data centers. The times of no-policy data centers are
gone with multi tenancy.

Not all packets are routed so at least some of the filtering must
occur before prerouting. I'm afraid you can't take yourself out
of the fast path that easily ;-)

This is not a pledge specific to nft. I would like to see more
numbers in general. We are putting APIs and frameworks in place that
we can't remove afterwards without knowing how they really scale and
perform.
