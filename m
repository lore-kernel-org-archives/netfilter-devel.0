Ugh. I got distracted before I finished replying.

I don't think the analysis is correct.

The unwind and the netns exit path should maintain the same constraints.
If they don't there is a bug, perhaps in initialization ordering.

Code should be able to count on net_generic() from the beginning of the
corresponding .init to the end of the corresponding .fini

Something like that is not happening and if we can I would like to track
down why.

Otherwise we need code like the above all over the place.
