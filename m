I wonder if that stuff can be simplified somehow.

We only use those options in two ways:

1) To process early in input via ip_options_compile()
   and the source route check in ip_rcv_finish()

2) To do forwarding processing on options in ip_forward_finish()
   and the multicast equivalent in ipmr.c

3) For locally destined packets, when the options are to be
   passed to the user via a recvmsg() CMSG.

Well, there is a 4th, which is what we're talking about here,
which is all of the zero'ing out of the thing during encapsulation
which is mostly a waste.

I think #1 and #2 can be handled by an on-stack copy of "struct
ip_options" high enough in the call chain, but #3 is a bit less
trivial to cope with like that.

It would be nice to kill the IPCB() copy, and give us 12 bytes back in
skb->cb[] :-)
