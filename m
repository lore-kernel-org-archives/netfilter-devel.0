The numbers I've shown were measuring the critical ingress path. I
never posted numbers on generic hook infrastructure.

It's ~10% less, because obviously we run more code in the generic hook
infrastructure, as they provide more features. So far it was only
possible to register one single chain at ingress. Eric Dumazet already
indicated that this benchmark only measures *one single CPU* and
icache is fully populated. The numbers with smp will go worse because
of the central lock contention.

These are the numbers I got banging *one single CPU*:
