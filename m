Not related to the patch:

That reminds me that Yoshifuji had the idea to cache the results for
ipv6_addr_type in IP6CB to avoid calling this function over and over again.
Maybe we can do the same for rt6_infos to save some cycles here and there.


Also, what do you think about this site:

net/ipv6/ip6_output.c:
    411 
    412                 rt = (struct rt6_info *) dst;
    413                 if (rt->rt6i_flags & RTF_GATEWAY)
    414                         target = &rt->rt6i_gateway;
    415                 else
    416                         target = &hdr->daddr;
    417 

Our provided skb_dst should come from ip6_route_input, thus ip6_pol_route. So
I assume we have rt6i_gateway == hdr->daddr there, too. It is a bit more
complicated because of possible routing extension headers. Maybe you already
looked at this already?

I just found it while searching which other code paths do emit packets
while xt_TEE is processing (generation of redirects) and could also lead
to stack exhaustion. But the path in ip6_forward seems fine.

Greetings,
