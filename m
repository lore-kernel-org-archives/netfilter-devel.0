Yes, doing that doesn't make sense to me.
And it is inconsitent:
Packets without socket information are queued normally
in your patch, but suddently if its a timewait socket
its an error?

Why would we want timewait packets to NOT be queued?
vs. for example forwarded packets?

Userspace can test for presence of the attributes, i.e.
no NFQA_UID attribute -> no socket present, or lack of uid
information.

If you have a counter-example?
