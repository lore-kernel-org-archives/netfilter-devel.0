In the next couple of weeks, I would like to post changes to epoll that
add busy polling support.

Who should be CC-ed on the patches?

BTW, Right now I'm seeing very good results.
I have tested with up to 10,000 sockets using sockperf.
There are a few more things I want to do before submitting.

Thanks,
Eliezer
