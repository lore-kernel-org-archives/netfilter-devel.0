Ok, though I would hope that we can come up with something a little
more intuative than that.

Ok, as it happens the code that looked like it should be modified was
using AF_ values, even though it deals with nf_inet_addr. As you mention
this, it looks like it should be possible to change all the relevant
ip_vs code over to use NFPROTO_ instead, but lets leave looking into
that for later.

I believe that the value IPPROTO_IP is only used in the case of fwmark.
Here is a explanation of why.

The value of protocol in ip_vs_ct_in_get() and ip_vs_conn_new()
can come from serveral sources:

1) If a fwmark in use, then it is set to IPPROTO_IP when dealing
   with templates for persistance.
2) If the entry is created by the FTP helper, IPPROTO_TCP is used.
3) If the entry is created by syncrhonisation of the table of another
   machine, then the protocol used in the foreign entry is used -
   which would have been set by one of these 4 cases.
4) Otherwise the value of iph.protocol is used. iph is set set as
   ip_vs_fill_iphdr(svc->af, skb_network_header(skb), &iph);

The key is that functions that provide cases 1), 2) and 4) are all called
from ip_vs_in() which filters packets so that, amongst other things, the
protocol is accepted by ip_vs_proto_get(). At this time, that means it must
be one of:

    IPPROTO_TCP (as per ip_vs_protocol_tcp)
    IPPROTO_UDP (as per ip_vs_protocol_udp)
    IPPROTO_AH  (as per ip_vs_protocol_ah)
    IPPROTO_ESP (as per ip_vs_protocol_esp)

I had thought about adding an explicit is_fwmark field to ip_vs_ct_in_get()
and ip_vs_conn_new(), but it would also need to be added to the syncronisation
protocol, changes to which seem best avoided for compatibility reasons.
