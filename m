Hello,

I would say, the problem is due to a sequence-number rewriting
middlebox, who does not correctly handle the SACK-blocks.

In remote.pcap, you see:
Packet#10: A Dup-ACK: ACK 1005503816, SACK: 1005505184-1005505648
The SACK actually covers Packet#9

In tun0.pcap, you have:
Packet#9: The one that is SACK'ed: SEQ: 3514869772
Packet#11: The Dup-ACK: ACK: 3514868404, SACK: 3570452498-3570452962

You can see that the SACK-block is not really aligned with the ACK-numbers.

Netfilter is probably dropping the Dup-ACK, because the SACK-block is
acknowledging unseen data.


There are middleboxes out there that randomize the sequence numbers, due to
an old bug in Windows, where the initial sequence number was not
sufficiently randomized. There are some of these middleboxes, who simply do
not support SACK, thus modify only the sequence numbers of the TCP-header
(https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-12668#TCP_Sequence_Number_Randomization_and_SACK).

This results in a TCP retransmission timeout on the sender, because of
the invalid SACK-blocks, the duplicate ACKs are not accounted. This
completly kills the performance, as you can see in our presentation given at
IETF87: http://tools.ietf.org/agenda/87/slides/slides-87-tcpm-11.pdf

We have a patch that accounts DUP-ACKs with invalid SACK-blocks effectively
as duplicate acknowledgments. I can send the patches, if the
netdev-community is interested in accepting these upstream.


Cheers,
Christoph
