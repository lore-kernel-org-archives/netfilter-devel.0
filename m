This patch set merges ipt_LOG and ip6t_LOG and adds ring buffer support
to xt_LOG.

Using "--ring" a user can create LOG rules which log messages into
one or more ring buffers.
Each ring buffer is represented as pipe-like file in
/proc/net/netfilter/xt_LOG_ring/.

Ring buffer support can be enabled/disabled using
CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_LOG_RING.

Changes since v1:
 - Merged ipt_LOG and ip6t_LOG
 - Implemented ring buffer support as part of xt_LOG.

Changes since v2:
 - Fixed struct xt_log_info_v1's data layout
 - Removed the sizeof(void *) hack
 - Replaced BUG() by WARN_ON_ONCE()

Changes since v3:
 - Merged xt_LOG_core.c and xt_LOG_ring.c into xt_LOG.c
 - Made checkpatch.pl happy

Changes since v4:
 - Fixed a typo in include/linux/netfilter/Kbuild
