That was the reason I initially suggested we need a better way to expose
netns topology through sysfs, which I still think is a good idea. How
about this...it's dangerous as it is right now to leave things global. I
suggest leaving the existing sysfs module parameter that only actually
touches the init_net ct and get the rest fixed up, then adding support
for exposing the topology better in sysfs and tweaking per-ns bits.

But maybe you want to fix it all at the same time.

Jon.
