My nft socket filtering changes are accomodated into struct sk_filter,
and will still be, so I still need some generic name there...

Please, leave this as it is.

You can just send me a patch to change it to void. It's an internal
kernel pointer as the comment states. There is **no** way that
userspace can lurk with that from iptables at all.
