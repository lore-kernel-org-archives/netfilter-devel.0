Chains can store multiple targets, so no loss.

1. table

First, I think some targets need to relax their restrictions, such as
with xt_DSCP.

Then, only a handful of extensions remain: CT, <all NATs>,
TPROXY and REJECT. Would anyone want to call these from act_ipt?
I doubt it. :)

2. hooks

Extensions with hook limit: <NAT>, TPROXY, REJECT, CLASSIFY.
Again, I don't quite see the value of attempting to NAT from act_ipt.
CLASSIFY {c|sh?}ould be relaxed, unless I am missing something.
