	Yes, may be nfnetlink subsys is unregistered first,
before ipvs and net->nfnl is already NULL. Note that
nf_conntrack_find_get returns existing conntrack, so
this module is still active for the net. Then I'm wondering,
may be this can happen even without IPVS if conntrack flushes
connections after nfnetlink is unregistered. Not sure, may be
nfnetlink_has_listeners() and other funcs need proper
rcu_dereference for net->nfnl under rcu. Also, nfnetlink_send
should free the skb if net->nfnl is NULL.

	In IPVS we can add checks to exit ip_vs_conn_drop_conntrack()
early if net cleanup is in progress because conntrack can be
loaded after IPVS and its cleanup called before IPVS.
We do not need to delete conntrack while in IPVS cleanup.
It should solve this problem but may be nfnetlink needs some
protection for net->nfnl too.
