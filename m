	I see, ip_vs_skb_hdr_ptr needs it.

	This is not going to work. You are trying to track
any locally delivered fragments. If cp is NULL it will crash.
There is no need to add check for !iph.fragoffs because
for iph.fragoffs != 0 we find cp with data from reasm,
I mean with ip_vs_skb_hdr_ptr.

	ok, better to initialize at least fragoffs.

	Yes, that is better. Because it is dangerous if
ip_vs_icmp_xmit tries to debug IP header in offset after ports,
we provide ciph there, it must be with valid len.

	But IPVS is working in LOCAL_IN, even fragments will
come with dst because they will be delivered locally after
input routing. So, there is no need to assign dst. In
PREROUTING there will be dst for loopback traffic. The
other traffic will get input route before reaching IPVS.
And it is dangerous to replace dst for the reason that
ip_vs_preroute_frag6 does not know if reasm was tracked
by IPVS, it can be just some netfilter packet. May be
it is a good idea to set reasm->ipvs_property at
some place, so that we know the packets are tracked
by IPVS. Then we can restrict ip_vs_preroute_frag6 to
work only for IPVS traffic.

	If all fragments from netfilter do not come with mark
that is derived from first fragment, may be it is better
IPVS just to get it from reasm, not to modify skb->mark
for every fragment because that can damage the mark,
someone may need to use different mark for all fragments.
IPVS can add method ip_vs_skb_mark that will prefer
mark from reasm because we need the mark only from
first fragment for scheduling and routing. As result,
we can remove ip_vs_preroute_frag6.

	I see, first fragment walks the stack starting
from nf_ct_frag6_output, it is transmitted, then the
following fragments are sent. OK but make sure we do
not leak skb->dst on skb_dst_copy because I suspect
that if fragments are sent over loopback they will come
on input with present dst. That is why ip6_rcv_finish
avoids input routing for local traffic. Do not replace
dst if it is already present, only the IPVS transmitters
should do it.

	I see. Note that IPVS transmitters do not
modify skb->dst for loopback traffic, see IP_VS_XMIT.
So, if skb->dst is present you do not need to use
skb_dst_copy, the fragments will come with dst.

	But do we really need to copy dst from first fragment.
All following fragments are going to find cp with data from
first fragment. Then the transmitters should assign the same
skb->dst because we are routing for the same cp.

	Hm, I have to check what happens if we decide to
mangle payload. Also, note that now ip_vs_nat_xmit_v6
should try to NAT ports only for first fragment, is that
handled? For IPv4 ip_local_deliver calls ip_defrag and
IPVS does not need to defrag but for IPv6 we must be able
to route all fragments and to be careful what to mangle,
ports are only in first fragment, right?
