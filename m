The only case that I see as being simple and unsurprising worked a bit
differently:

We currently have:

ns_of_pid(task_pid(tsk))
tsk->nsproxy->pid_ns


I would reduce the usage of tsk->nsproxy->pid_ns as much as possible,
and use ns_of_pid(task_pid(tsk)) for all of the routine things that
need to know the pid namespace of a process.  Possibly even to the point
or reversing the order of the upid array so using it is more efficient.

I would leave tsk->nsproxy->pid_ns for use by fork/clone when allocating
a childs pid number.

The unsharing process would have to become the child reaper.  I think the first
child would become pid 1 in that pid namespace.


>From an implementation point of view who gets pid 1 when the child_reaper is
not visible inside the pid namespace doesn't make much difference but we would
want to carefully look at the details so we minimize userspace confusion.


I don't think a process tree rooted at pid 0 is a show stopper.  It is
somewhat confusing but we already have a forked process tree today,
and user space certainly hasn't fallen over.  In the case of a join if you want
to live in properly in the process tree you can daemonize and become a child
of init.




I think replacing a struct pid for another struct pid allocated in
descendant pid_namespace (but has all of the same struct upid values
as the first struct pid) is a disastrous idea.  It destroys the
uniqueness of struct pid and we have a lot of places where we check
that for equality of pid pointers, and that now would be broken.
Otherthings like proc directories also used a cached struct pid and
would start thinking the process was gone when it was not.
