Right. And it's not just the set size function that changes the value
(it wasn't in this case) so it's not sufficient to say that there is a
generic function to set the size. That only applies to the hashtable in
the global init_net anyway, changing the hashtable sizes and then
leaving the existing hashes as they were.

Additionally, the size is writeable in the module sysfs entry. So it's
not read only, even though I agree that the procfs visable entry is. I
really think this does need fixing, and I'm not just being a pain in the
ass - I have another issue here clearly with memory corruption, but the
need for this to be cleaned up is real.

Jon.
