imho, the point maybe is that a scheduler should work at layer 3,
am i wrong?
i mean: i made the same question to myself and answered that
the right level should be the third... this would account for tcp
retransmissions as well as forward error corrections packets
added by some application on top of udp, or retrasmissions by
applications on udp... or... whatever...

maybe my reasoning is less foggy if i first answer to an other
question:

i would like to account for the number of bytes sent to the wire
on behalf of each flow :)

this seems not to be possible, afaik, with that patch i wrote. the only
skbs that are freed are those that are internally allocated. and the
only kfree_skb() that can happen on skbs that are enqueued in dev.c
should be those in case od a TC_ACT_QUEUED or TC_ACT_STOLEN,
where they should just decrement the user counter. i say "should" since
this is the most reasonable assumption i managed to make, but
this is your field and you definitely know it much better than me :)
in that case, btw, dev.c doesn't get any drop return code...

if a drop return code is given, the packet is not freed internally, but
only "externally".  (for the "where"... the question is open in "billing 1")

where could a skb be freed then?

[ i'm not insisting with that patch, i'm just trying to say that, if i don't
rave, it should not be dangerous to do that after the enqueue()...
then, it's just that for the moment i can't immagine a different
way to do things in that place :) yes, there could be a slight
variation with a skb_get() right before the enqueue and all the
kfree_skb() at their place inside the code, but then somewhere
we should always add a kfree_skb... ouch... and we would need
a by ref skb anyway to get the packet that has been dropped
and if it's not the same as the enqueued one also the enqueued
one should pass through one more kfree_skb()... horrible, more
complex and slower i'd say... ]

i need to think thoroughly on it... depending on where that information is
kept, the complexity of some operations can change a lot... and i should
not only egoistically think to the operations i need but look at it from the
outside to have a less partisan viewpoint on the problem and find the
most generally good solution possible.

yeah, that could be the right compromise :)

this is the case. i could do it on my own from inside my code, but then 
i would
"pollute" the information seen from other parts of the kernel code and i 
would
introduce a _new_ unfairness between those flows that pass though my qdisc
and those that don't... to sum it up... it would be pretty unclean

you are thinking in that perspective because of tcp? as i said above, i 
would stop at layer 3...
btw, if i don't misunderstand what you mean, i guess it's when tcp is 
retransmitting that that
field should somehow be set... is it as feasible when we are not on an 
end-point as when
we are an endpoint? btw, we should then do the same with the other 
protocols and, for
example with udp, it would become application dependent... a suicide?

sorry?? i'm lost... maybe there's something implied i can't get...
do you agree it's not the same skb that will be re-billed
afterwards?
