Correct, the unconfirmed list exists only for cleanup.

Good question, that looks unnecessary :)

If a new conntrack is created in PRE_ROUTING or LOCAL_OUT, it will be
added to the unconfirmed list and moved to the hash as soon as the
packet passes POST_ROUTING. This means the number of unconfirmed entrie=
s
created by the network is bound by the number of CPUs due to BH
processing. The number created by locally generated packets is unbound
in case of preemptible kernels however.

Its used for cleaning up conntracks not in the hash table yet on
module unload (or manual flush). It is supposed to be write-only
during regular operation.

So I guess we should check the CONFIRMED bit when searching
in the hash table.
