Hi Daniel
The progress is good, so far I think everything is ported except for
Simon Hormans latest patch-set. 

Right now I'm struggling with NULL pointers :-)
i.e. seq_file doesn't carry any netns info.

In the example below *net will be invalid because seq->private is NULL.

static void *ip_vs_info_seq_next(struct seq_file *seq, ....) {
struct net *net = seq_file_net(seq);

single_open() seems to work, but seq_open() or seq_open_private().

As you can see I'm not ready, so help will be nice.
I'll remove some debugging stuff and send you a patch-set.

/Hans
