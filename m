There are three modes in OSF: LAN where things are simple, no-ttl, where
things are even more simpler and false positive, and heueristic mode,
which checks ttl, but with some addons. Like if ttl is 31, it is
possible that it is OS with initial TTL being equal to 32, and other OS,
with initial TTL 48, and whatever other checks succeeded for that cases,
determine what OS is.

It works quite good in internet not only LAN, since it is frequently
only enough to roughly determine initial TTL.

Security checkers do like to put its hands into sooo deep places in the stack :)
