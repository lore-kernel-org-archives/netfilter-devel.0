memcpy of 'bpf_prog' is not just 'not a beauty', it won't work, since
bpf_prog is freed via work_queue due to JIT. See bpf_jit_free()
There are few other ways I could think of embedding bpf_prog inside
sk_filter: 1. have a release callback, 2. extra field inside bpf_prog
that will tell outer size of the container (so that all kfree(bpf_prog*)
can adjust the pointer before freeing). 3. extra field which is direct
pointer to the outer container, so that kfree(bpf_prog*) can use it
instead of freeing the bpf_prog itself.
In all cases it means hacking jit compilers for all architectures
in a very ugly way.
Say, we pick #3 (which is the least ugly), see how
kfree(fp) will change to
kfree(fp->pointer_to_outer_container).
it will be not obvious at all to the reader that bpf_prog itself will be
freed by such kfree()... so we'd need to add nasty comments
everywhere...
imo one extra load of fp->prog in critical path of SK_RUN_FILTER
is not worth this mess.

This is not pretty either, since we'd need to worry that alignment
of sk->data field must match alignment of bpf_prog. Probably can
make it 'long data[0]'...  all of these just feels wrong to avoid
single load in SK_RUN_FILTER().
