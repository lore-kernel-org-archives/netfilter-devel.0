Yes, no problem, wait a bit please.

Btw, I think the bestest way (and surely more clean)
would be to use some new form of the sysctl templates.

But I didn't find such a form of writting which would
sutisfy me. Since you said those enums are written in
stone it's safe to use iterative fasion indeed but
as I see you found them not that "pretty" too :)

On the other hand -- if per-net initialization is not
that critical in speed (ie some speed could be sacrificed
for the code clarity -- I could play with those templates
maybe). Just a thought.
