Pulled, thanks.

I have fixed some minor glitches, see below.

        ^^^^
Please, use consistent tagging across patches (sometimes this is in
uppercase, sometimes lowercase).

I think using the same tagging is good for grepping for changes.

I have also removed the CC tag to David Miller in those two patches
above from H. Hartely, they are not useful anymore.

     ^^^

This one missed "net: " or "sock: " tag in the beginnging. I added
"net: " here.

I have manually fixed this, but you'll have to rebase your tree, sorry.
