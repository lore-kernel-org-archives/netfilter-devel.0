How exactly would that work? I guess we couldn't do NAT with
the encrypted packet anymore?

I would prefer something similar to the second set of patches.
Instead of calling netif_rx we could use NF_HOOK and simulate
the relevant parts of the input path for IPv4 and NAT. This
would assure that statistics are still correct and tcpdump is
not affected, which were Yoshifuji's biggest concerns if I
understood correctly.
