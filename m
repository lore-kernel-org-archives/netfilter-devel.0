Just verified it, at least in 2.6.15.6 tcpdump shows the defragmented
packet on br0.

Your patch solves the problem - tcpdump now shows the refragmented
packets on eth1. Thanks for the quick solution.

Just a note, your patch does not work when bridge is compiled as a
module. In this case modprobe failes with "bridge: Unknown symbol
ip_fragment". Using CONFIG_BRIDGE=y works.

I don't think so, with your patch IPsec connection can be established
again. The problem was that racoon generates UDP packets of length 2600
during isakmp phase 1 which did not pass the bridge.

The setup here is UML behind tap1 where br0 is used to bridge the
physical interface (eth1) to the UML's eth0 (=> tap1). The IPsec
connection is going from the UML to the outside world over the bridge.
NAT is not used and at the moment filtering is just used for
accounting. So nothing special, only two rules in the FORWARD chain
that accept all traffic in both directions.
