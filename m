I looked more closely at your preempt_disable() suggestion, which you
presented earlier as follows:

I am concerned about the following sequence of events:

o	synchronize_sched_expedited() disables preemption, thus blocking
	offlining operations.

o	CPU 1 starts offlining CPU 0.  It acquires the CPU-hotplug lock,
	and proceeds, and is now waiting for preemption to be enabled.

o	synchronize_sched_expedited() disables preemption, sees
	that CPU 0 is online, so initializes and queues a request,
	does a wake-up-process(), and finally does a preempt_enable().

o	CPU 0 is currently running a high-priority real-time process,
	so the wakeup does not immediately happen.

o	The offlining process completes, including the kthread_stop()
	to the migration task.

o	The migration task wakes up, sees kthread_should_stop(),
	and so exits without checking its queue.

o	synchronize_sched_expedited() waits forever for CPU 0 to respond.

I suppose that one way to handle this would be to check for the CPU
going offline before doing the wait_for_completion(), but I am concerned
about races affecting this check as well.

Or is there something in the CPU-offline process that makes the above
sequence of events impossible?

							Thanx, Paul
