because afaics before packets were just sent from the bridge, i.e. no
forward path and no should_deliver() check.

Well, I am all for doing this with existing tools, problem is
userspace didn't change but newer kernels don't work as they used to.

If consensus is 'too bad, fix configuration' I can accept that.
The fact that noone seems to have reported this until now
pretty much proves that virtually noone has such configurations.

Not sure if this is even possible, as 10.1 would discard the syn/ack
from 10.2 (expects reply from 10.8 address).

But I think understand what you're saying.

I failed to come up with something that isn't more explicit ;)
But I'll try.

Sounds reasonable.

Yes. It wasn't necessary before.  If the consensus is that it should be
used in this case, I am ok with that.

I wanted to make sure that this extra DNAT crud is not e.g. called in
the multi/broadcast flood case, but only for plain br_forward().

Noted, thanks for reviewing.
