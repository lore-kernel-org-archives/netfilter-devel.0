Indeed, we've been discussing several possibilities depending, short
summary:

1) Autoload br_netfilter from the configuration path, as it happens
   with many other netfilter modules. However, {ip,ip6,arp}tables are
   decoupled from br_netfilter, so we don't have an obvious way to know if
   you're using them from the bridge.

2) Florian proposed to detect this from the packet path. The idea is
   to move the bridge-nf-call sysctl entries to the bridge core, then if
   you see the first bridged packet and bridge-nf-call is set to 1
   (from sysctl or sysfs), the br_netfilter is requested via workqueue
   and the packets are dropped until the br_netfilter module is in place.
   Then, wait for some time to disable bridge-nf-call by default.

My consideration to not follow 2) was that users only need to
'modprobe br_netfilter' if they really need this. This breakage is not
forcing users to upgrade userspace binaries. Instead, it is asking for
some explicit consent from the user.

Sorry, I should have Cc you since the beginning in this discussion. It
was too late when I realized. I can live with going 2) if you think
it's the way to go.

Let us know if you have a better idea. Thanks!
