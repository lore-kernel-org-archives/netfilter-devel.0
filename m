Thank you Pablo.

I generally just let rate-interval to default to 1, but I've added the
toggle to give the user more control on how often to sample the packet
rate. This wasn't an option before since we would always keep "delta" as
1 jiffy, but that is not the case in the new algorithm. Hence I have
exposed it as an option to the user.

Also, it looks like I broke the build on ARM and m68k arch. This is
because of the u64 division issue (sorry about that). I have sent
another patch to fix the problem "[PATCH] netfilter: xt_hashlimit: fix
64 bit division compile error". Please apply and send to net-next.

Thanks,
Vishwanath
