I think I cannot help to address this conflict myself.

8fbfef7f505b is in my nf tree, while 489111e5c25b is in net-next. So
you will hit this conflict by when you pull net into net-next.

So please keep this patch from Stephen to resolve the conflict in your
radar to solve this.

Or let me know if you come up with any way I can handle this from here
to reduce your burden. Thanks.
