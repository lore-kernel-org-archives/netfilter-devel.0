I still propose that you tcpdump it, then I can tell you (I know
enough about Thomas' case but yours has a large number of
unknowns)... :-) I don't know why 2.6.24 didn't suffer from the
problem as FRTO was enabled already in it. The command you need
to create dump.log file:

# tcpdump -w dump.log -i <iface> host <peerip>

...you need root rights (or sudo) to do the capturing.
