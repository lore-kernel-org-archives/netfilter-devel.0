Perhaps. I must admit I'm not very familiar with this code
area/interface, so I preferred to fix the few specific cases instead
of submitting a general patch, which might have some unexpected side
effects, e.g. behavior different from one of the internal clients etc.

If you think one check in netlink_unicast_kernel is a better way to do
it, I'm happy to implement it like that.

Thanks,
Mateusz
