Yes, exactly.

There's a middlebox in the path wich breaks SACK completely and conntrack 
drops (technically marks as INVALID) the packets with bogus SACK options.

It can be fixed by fixing the middlebox, or disabling SACK by the 
TCPOPTSTRIP target, or by relaxing conntrack. For the latter, the next 
untested patch may be sufficient:

diff --git a/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_proto_tcp.c b/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_proto_tcp.c
index 7dcc376..8b5d783 100644

+	if (!(before(sack, receiver->td_end + 1) &&

 		 before(seq, sender->td_maxend + 1),
 		 after(end, sender->td_end - receiver->td_maxwin - 1),

However it is good to cover the issue thus?

*Any* netfilter configuration where the non-allowed TCP packets are 
dropped and not rejected breaks the ACK challenges. That is why I consider 
only section 5 useful from RFC 5961.
