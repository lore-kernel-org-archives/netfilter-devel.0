Perhaps I'm missing anything but either way (IPv6 as module or
built-in) the symbol is still defined. With my patch applied, xt_LOG
now depends on IP6_NF_IPTABLES, which depends on IPV6.

Moreover we've got other xt_ target and matches that contain both IPv4
and IPv6 support that don't require this.

Let me know.
