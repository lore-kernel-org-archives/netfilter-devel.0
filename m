Right. I'll post updated version with the rename tomorrow.

Yes, the patch submitted here is against current nf branch. For
SLES 11 SP1 (with 2.6.32 kernel), I'm going to use call_rcu() the way
original commit 68b80f11 does. IIRC the only pre-3.0 stable branch still
maintained is 2.6.32, all others are 3.0 or newer so they have
kfree_rcu() and also use it in __nf_ct_ext_add() since commit 1f8d36a1.
