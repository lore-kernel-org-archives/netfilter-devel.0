We had to RCU quiesce to be sure old rules were not any more used befor=
e
freeing them. Alternative is to defer freeing via call_rcu() but
subject to OOM.

With 200 basic rules, size of rules table is about 40960 bytes per cpu.

This kind of monolithic huge object is hard to handle with RCU semantic=
,
more suitable for handling set of small objects (struct file for exampl=
e),
even if RCU can have a backoff of 10000 elements in its queue...

In my humble opinion, this is a reasonnable compromise, and Stephen pat=
ch
version 4 is ok for me.
