If we integrate it would mean a new/alternative interface
to tc where you compile the filter/configuratoin before
uploading. We believe this is a good thing since it allows
admins to (syntax) check the filter before inserting it.
I believe the guys from shorewall sees this as a missing
feature of iptables.

Would you consider such an interface for tc good are bad?

current scheme cant handle dynamic rules - and it will
be a while (if ever) before it can.

no - if someone decided to write their own "client/compiler" in
userspace they could potentially produce a broken IDD - that
could crash the kernel!

Well, then you need to think again - it is in fact a coincidence!
