Yes, but we don't add it for SYNs containing data.

It might be wrong, but so is dropping ICMP fragmentation required
packets. This is a workaround for broken behaviour and you should
of course only use MSS values that you know are valid.

Its mainly used for ISPs surpressing ICMP fragmentation required
messages. That affects hosts not adding an MSS option as well.

Well, he's about 10 years late.

I agree, it shouldn't drop packets unless it really has to.
Please go ahead with a new patch.
