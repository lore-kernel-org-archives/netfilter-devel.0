Calling a function is expensive.

What was now a leaf function deep in the call chain, will no longer
be, so GCC will need to push all live registers onto the stack,
then reload them back into registers when ipv6_skip_exthdr() returns.

And that function is expensive, it's a lot of code that %99 of the
time serves no purpose at all.

This will be executed for every single packet we process, and Linux
can process millions of packets per second, so every cycle and every
memory reference matters.

And we can address such a problem at that time.

Can you show a real life setup that sees ipv6 packets with extension
headers and would be effected by this?

Really, I do not want to bloat up this path with useless code
execution when for all practical purposes it really doesn't matter.
