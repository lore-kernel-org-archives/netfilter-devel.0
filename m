I believe basically any transition which relies on people reading feature-removal-schedule or kernel messages and a flag day is just kidding ourselves and things will break for everyone except maybe some distributions at flag day.

I think taking compatibility seriously means we can't really change the default behaviour, but can only allow people to manually undo the damage and make sure they won't rely on this behaviour for at least nftables.

Or we can change it. But then why wait for two years, it won't change anything. 

Is there a way to make the userspace tools detect that the compat behaviour needs to be activated?
