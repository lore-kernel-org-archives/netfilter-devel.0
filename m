I think these patches are a lost cause. Besides the fact that they
move things to the kernel instead of to userspace, they

- break the existing interface
- do not use netlink
- are a drop-in replacement instead of incremental changes or a
   completely new implementation
- fix only a very small part of the problems of the current
   iptables design

I've asked Hamid to post these patches to see if there were any
useful incremental changes that would make sense to apply to
iptables, but it seems to come down to moving userspace to kernel
to support incremental changes.
