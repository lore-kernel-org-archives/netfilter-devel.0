commit 6c0801c9ab19fc2f4c1e2436eb1b72e0af9a317b

    task_work: Replace spin_unlock_wait() with lock/unlock pair
    
    There is no agreed-upon definition of spin_unlock_wait()'s semantics,
    and it appears that all callers could do just as well with a lock/unlock
    pair.  This commit therefore replaces the spin_unlock_wait() call in
    task_work_run() with a spin_lock_irq() and a spin_unlock_irq() aruond
    the cmpxchg() dequeue loop.  This should be safe from a performance
    perspective because ->pi_lock is local to the task and because calls to
    the other side of the race, task_work_cancel(), should be rare.
