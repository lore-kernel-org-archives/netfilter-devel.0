Seems a good idea (but you might need some IPv6 care, as ( dst =
dst_check(dst, 0); ) seems to handle IPv4 only)

Another idea would be to re-use TCP ehash so that regular IP early demux
can be used, with a single lookup for both local and forwarded sessions.

(That would probably require a bit more memory, as you would need to
insert into TCP ehash some kind of 'tiny sockets' )
