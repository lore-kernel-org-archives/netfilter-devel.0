hello,
Because of i increase icmp header by 8 bytes the next layer IP headers are not
fully added to skbuff that is they become short and i am repeatedly getting
ip_hook : happy cracking message
so where can i modify the total size of alloc_skb to satisfy my constraints
for icmp header?
i got one reference mail that some person has done adding his own header to
ping packet and send it to other machine.he actually added that successfully.
i am unable to contact him. might be his email address has been changed.
regards,
parag.

You're sending out IP packets which don't even contain the IP header,
and you're running connection tracking or some filtering.

The message is not serious.
