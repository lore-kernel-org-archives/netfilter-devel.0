How is it better than -m socket ? It's used with tproxy, but not only,
and works quite well, thought it only supports TCP and UDP.

Something like
  iptables -N INPUT_SOCKET
  iptables -I INPUT -m socket -j INPUT_SOCKET
would achieve similar results, if I got you right.

-m socket implies in a double-lookup for the socket, yes, but that
sounds a reasonable price to pay for this while not inserting another
hook. I know of deployments using -m socket for tproxy and handling very
high rates, performance has not been a problem..

Sounds like you want a boosted socket match, perhaps borrowing some of
the features from owner match.
