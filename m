Considering that the allocation gfp flag here is GFP_ATOMIC (why is it
GFP_ATOMIC btw?), it might fail for a variety of reasons which may
occur when the system is "healthy", for example - if it needs disk I/O
to allocate.

Either way, you shouldn't be dereferencing NULL ptrs even when the
system is really low on memory.
