ok, great.

this could be a problem.  I think there is quite a number of users who
want to impose packet filtering on outgoing locally-originated
packets... and obviously you want to do that at some time _before_ you
hide everything behind crypto..

This sounds a bit like the existing problem with bridgewalling.  They
also have no idea of where the packet originally came from (at least
before the physdev stuff was introduced as solution to this).
