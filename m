I gave one simple example for blocking in the commit message,
that's true, but it is not limited to that, meaning we can have
much different scenarios/policies that netfilter allows us than
just blocking, e.g. fine grained settings where applications are
allowed to connect/send traffic to, application traffic marking/
conntracking, application-specific packet mangling, and so on,
just think of the whole netfilter universe.
