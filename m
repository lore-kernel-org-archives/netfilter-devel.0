That seems reasonable.

Yes it will.  I intend to do that after this patchset settles so I am
not dealing with more than one issue at a time.  Otherwise there
is too much work at once.

I would have expected this patch to be somewhere.  I did not see
this change in net-next when I wrote the patchset (which seemed
like a good approximation of the latest thing available).  If I
overlooked and the patch has already made it to Dave then my apologies
for being redundant.

I still don't see this patch in your pending branch.

Am I missing something?

Fair enough.  For me those parens are necessary to trust the compiler is
doing the right thing.  I can never remember the C operator precedence
rules.

Thank you.
