This seems unrelated to the patch.

I *think* that you're trying to say that 'if the packet is deemed
invalid by conntrack, skb->nfct will be set to NULL and 0 will be
returned.' I think that this is a documentation issue separate from
this patch (Maybe could be combined with one of the earlier fragments
in the series?).

The comment points out what I think is the more obvious piece here:
that the helper should be executed when the connection is/will be
committed. The piece that I found less obvious was that "cached"
implies that the helper was already executed (and therefore it
shouldn't be run again). I don't know if there's a way to make this
more obvious, for example with a "helper_executed" variable or
similar. Up to you.
