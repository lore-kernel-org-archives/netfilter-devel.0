You are saying that the decision should be based on the original
destination address rather the modified one? I would say the opposite:

- If a non-link-local destination is changed into a link-local one, it
should certainly not be rerouted because routing doesn't make much
sense for link-local destinations.

- If a link-local destination is changed into a non-link-local one,
why not reroute it according to the new destination?

If you do not agree, we can also put the check in
ip6t_local_out_hook() where the original destination is still
available.

Dries.
