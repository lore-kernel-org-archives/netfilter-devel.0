On normal situation, we always finish the lookup :

1) If we found the thing we were looking at.

2) We get the list end (item not found), we then check if it is the
expected end.

It is _not_ the expected end only if some writer deleted/inserted an
element in _this_ chain during our lookup.

Because our lookup is lockless, we then have to redo it because we migh=
t
miss the object we are looking for.

If we can do the 'retry' a 10 times, it means the attacker was really
clever enough to inject new packets (new conntracks) at the right
moment, in the right hash chain, and this sounds so higly incredible
that I cannot believe it at all :)
