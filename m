I gave it a shot but it isn't easy.  We can figure out the length of
the IP headers just fine, but the rest of the value we need to add
to the MSS (the TCP header length) is transport specific which kind
of implies a transport dependent gso proto op of some sort.

Or we just hack it, admit that only TCP creates GSO packets, and
directly check for TCP protcol and then inspect the TCP header
length :-)
