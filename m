This patchset resolves some issues I've come across while investigating nft hash
sets.

The first patch requires users of rhashtable to define a max_shift as suggested
by Daniel Borkmann and Thomas Graf. One side-effect of not setting max_shift is
that tables are not allowed to expand. I was observing this behavior with nft
hash sets prior to these changes.

The next patch implements this requirement for nft hash sets using desc->size as
the max_shift if it's provided by the user. If not, it falls back to a newly
defined default of 1024 elements. This value is somewhat arbitrary, but seems
like a reasonable default to me.

I used 'size' above for max_shift because it appears to be used as a ceiling for
the number of elements in a set in nft_add_set_elem(). It's also used in the
estimate fn. Prior to the next patch 'size' was also being used as the nelem_hint
to pass to rhashtable_init(). This seems incorrect since nelem_hint is meant to
provide a hint for how many hash buckets to initially allocate.

Instead of using 'size' for nelem_hint, the final patch introduces a new set
parameter named 'init_size'. If this approach is acceptable I can provide the
userspace patches to fully implement the new parameter.

The patchset is against net-next.

  rhashtable: require max_shift definition
  nft_hash: define max_shift rhashtable param
  nft_hash: introduce init_size set parameter
