These are some of the challenges i posed to Allesandro as well.

The discussion with fairness lead to my assertion above.
None of the above take care of fairness factor that Alessandro is trying
to achieve. So my thinking is if we wanna fix the unbill problem, why
not address the whole issue and get accounting to be an embedded piece.

I suspect in such a case you have a passive box which just gets a copy
of the packet from the wire ;-> Someone else in the real box where the
packet gets forwarded will drop the packet and it will still be paid 
for ;->
In the case of what you have introduced though, you are billing for
localy generated packets as well (if i am not mistaken this is where the
issues are).

In general i dont think we need to be 100% accurate. PSAMP for example
operates by merely sampling i.e not taking a precise measurement. People
have written tons of papers to prove it was good enuf.
