As you noted, the particular problem of resolving the different LSMs 
still exists, including the issue of multiplexing per-object state 
which is likely to be one of the larger roadblocks to such an approach.  
However, in dealing with the issue of personal firewalls I think the 
biggest issue will be the user interaction as you described ... how do 
you explain to a user who clicked the "allow" button that the system 
rejected their traffic?

Unfortunately I don't think this solves the problem, it just changes it 
slightly.  It is no longer "How do I enable SELinux and XXX personal 
firewall?" but instead "How do I enable SELinux's network access 
controls and XXX personal firewall?"
