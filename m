But the difference between you example (cp /dev/zero /dev/mem) and 
passing unchecked data to the kernel is... you _can_ check the data and 
do something about it if you discover that the data is not valid/within 
a range/whatever even if the user has full permissions.
No same person would do a 'cp /dev/zero /dev/mem', but passing bad data 
is more likely to happen, badly written userspace configuration tools etc.
