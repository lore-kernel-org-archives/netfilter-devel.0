They are, but the metadata is not. Sorry for not being clear, but my
previous mail was. i.e. there is a per-netns hashtable that is indexed
using a global that might change at any time underneath. The htable size
and max should be per-netns too.

An existing sysctl/module parameter affects these and should also
ultimately either iterate through namespaces, or only affect the global
init_net (as it almost does now, except it changes the data used by the
others and doesn't resize them).

Jon.
