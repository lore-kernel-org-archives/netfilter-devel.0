Pablo, your call.

I would suggest to re-target patches #1 and #3 to nf tree, I can do
this, just let me know.

Alternative is to just add the nf_ct_frag6_consume_orig call to
openvswitch and handle that via net tree.

I can then wait for that change to pop up in nf-next and just resend
this series (which will then undo that change).

Let me know, thanks!

Indeed, that seems like the least invasive change.

Feel free to submit this to -net, there is no dependency on any of the
other changes.
