So I have read through the code and I simply do not see anywhere
that would prevent code in nft_queue to be called on a per netdevice
chain, or where in nfqnl_enqueue_packet we would decided not to queue
the packet.

Could you please point me to what in the code makes this code path
impossible to use?

Right now it looks like something that is triggerable in 4.1.
