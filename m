It certainly should be configurable. I've already sent it to the list, but
you can also download it from
http://dexter.hensema.net/~erik/patches/sit-promote-mark-2.4.21-pre4.diff

It should be easy to port this patch to gre and maybe ipip (don't know the
code of the latter, but I assume it's similar to gre and sit). I'll work on
that tomorrow, when I've got access to my development machine again.

In my current patch the configuration option is called 'IPv6: Promote
netfilter MARK value to sit packets'.
I don't think we should call it 'preserve', because technically that's not
what is happening. The tunnel interface creates a fresh new packet, with a
fresh new nfmark. Propagate seems to be the right term to me (as a
non-native english speaker).
