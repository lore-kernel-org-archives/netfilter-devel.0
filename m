Based on what the documentation and the commit message of the commit
introducing xt_CHECKSUM module say, it seems so. But I must admit I'm
not sure where is the target is used and how (and why). In particular,
our issue was most likely result of

  https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible-tests/blob/master/test-prepare-host.yml#L196-L197

where they explicitely confine it to TCP packets. Unfortunately these
lines come from "Initial testing commit" so it's hard to say what the
intention behind that was.
