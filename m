Actually, that should still work.

For example, if you're like me and the nexthops all go to different
devices then it's obviously OK as inet_select_addr will pick the
right one for the device.  If they're going through the same device
but to different gateways then it'll still pick the right one for
the given gateway.

It only breaks when all your nexthops go to the same gateway (can't
happen) or if somehow the gateway addresses don't match up with your
desired source address.

In that case I really think that you should use SNAT :)

Cheers,
