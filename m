One comment, its again a global thing..

I've been playing with the idea for a while now to make all RCU
implementations into proper objects so that you can do things like:

  struct atomic_rcu_domain my_rcu_domain = create_atomic_rcu();

  atomic_rcu_read_lock(&my_rcu_domain());
  ...

  atomic_rcu_read_unlock(&my_rcu_domain());

and

  call_atomic_rcu(&my_rcu_domain, &my_obj->rcu_head, do_something);

etc..

We would have:

  atomic_rcu  --  'classic' non preemptible RCU (treercu these days)
  sleep_rcu   --  'preemptible' RCU

Then have 3 default domains:

sched_rcu     -- always atomic_rcu
rcu           -- depends on PREEMPT_RCU
preempt_rcu   -- always sleep_rcu

This would allow generic code to:
  1) use preemptible RCU for those cases where needed
  2) create smaller RCU domains where needed, such as in this case
  3) mostly do away with SRCU

Now I realize that the presented RCU implementation has a different
grace period method than the existing ones that use the timer tick to
drive the state machine, so 2) might not be too relevant here. But maybe
we can do something with different grace periods too.

Anyway, just an idea because I always get a little offended at the hard
coded global variables in all these RCU implementations :-)
