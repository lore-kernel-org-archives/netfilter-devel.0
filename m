BTW, since some of the frags (esp. the one that triggers the problem)
are added post-routing, a valid dst is available. It just isn't the first
frag in the particular scenario.

So, one solution would be to set skb->dst for the head (if NULL)  based
on a non-null fragment skb->dst. I believe that would prevent the problem
case without dropping the fragment, since it'll be processed post-routing
only if one of the frags is.

When I was looking at it, I wondered if conntrack really has a need to
reassemble itself, though. Couldn't it let IP do the reassembling and
just ignore offset != 0 frags? The offset==0 frags will have enough
protocol header to identify by port (a requirement for ICMP). But I don't
know this code well enough to know if conntrack does actually need
to reassemble for some good reason. Superficially, I wouldn't think
there'd be a reason for it.
