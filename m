Exactly this functionality already exists by way of the BROUTING chain
in the broute table. Currently, link-local packets are hardcodedly
treated as local before they even reach that chain. Nick's patch, in
conjunction with BROUTING, provides exactly what you're trying to do.

Now, without bridge netfilter, your patch becomes rather useless while
Nick's patch still allows per-group (and therefore per-protocol)
control.

Further, Nick's patch is considerably less intrusive.

I would therefore ask for Nick's patch to be merged.

P.S.: this whole issue is starting to get rather annoying
