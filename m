Right, thats better.

I did not do this since it means modprobe bridge.ko will no longer
register the needed sysctls, and I deemed autoloading pointless
since that means the hooks are registered on bridge.ko load.

Also, it seems to be that we will have to wait forever to eventually
get rid of the autoload...

Hmm, not sure if its safe to do this, e.g. with bridge=y,
br_netfilter=m, module might not yet be present in such cases?

Also, what about this:
iptables-restore < rules.txt
modprobe bridge
brctl addbr ...
brctl addif ...

at this point, any packet forwarded by bridge is filtered
via iptables.

After your patch, this might no longer be the case, if the modprobe
call is delayed (maybe this is far-fetched and not an issue in practice)?

2nd hypothetical issue:
modprobe bridge
sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=0

The sysctl could fail when br_nf_core is not yet present.

Agreed.

Sure, go ahead.

I see.  Yes, that makes sense.

Another alternative would be to merge both approaches.
I.e, use my patch, but move all the hook registration to
your proposed br_nf_core module.

The sysctls would still be registered from bridge.ko.

Then, if call_iptables is set and iptables rules are active,
do the module autoload and print the warning from your patch, telling
people to modprobe br_nf_core if they want the filtering.

Unfortunately, we'd have to export (from bridge.ko) some hook
to allow br_nf_core to signal that the hooks have been registered.

Then, in two years or so, we would remove the autoload hook
in the packet procesing path.

The only other disadvantage that I see is that we'd still have
the bridge-nf-* sysctls in bridge.ko rather than the new glue module.
