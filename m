Hi David,

The following patchset contains three Netfilter fixes, they are:

* Fix conntrack helper re-assignment after NAT mangling if only if
  the same helper is attached to the conntrack again, from Florian
  Westphal.

* Don't allow the creation of conntrack entries via ctnetlink if the
  original and reply tuples are missing, from Florian Westphal.

* Fix broken sysctl interface in nf_ct_reasm while adding netns support
  to it, from Michal Kubecek.

Again, these are coming very late but they seem small and non-intrusive=
 to me.
If case your verdict is positive, you can pull this changes from:

git://1984.lsi.us.es/nf master

Thanks!

  netfilter: ctnetlink: don't permit ct creation with random tuple
  netfilter: nf_ct_helper: don't discard helper if it is actually the s=
ame
