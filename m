Was it? Quoting Patrick from 24h prior to this post:

You do not need to do it, but I will happily look at this.
Of course my observations are the same as yours:

The two are statistically independent though. Even for a loaded=20
ruleset, the TLB/DC miss accumulation will be desastrous - as I've foun=
d=20
with linked-list rules/small allocs.

=2E. as is already done for jumpstack ;-)
