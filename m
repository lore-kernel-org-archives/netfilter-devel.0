Bruno suggested NFLOG target + ulogd.  That's not ideal, but doable.  At
least each container should be able to do that for itself.  What it
won't do is let a host admin make sure that he doesn't get corrupted
syslog entries when partial-lines get sent from several containers and
the kernel and randomly spliced together.  It also would simply be
better if the information was *always* sent to userspace instead of
syslog.
