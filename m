From: Pablo Neira Ayuso <pablo@netfilter.org>

The nat_rtp_rtcp hook takes two separate parameters port and rtp_port.

port is expected to be the real h245 address (found inside the packet).
rtp_port is the even number closest to port (RTP ports are even and
RTCP ports are odd).

However currently, both port and rtp_port are having same value (both are
rounded to nearest even numbers).

This works well in case of openlogicalchannel with media (RTP/even) port.

But in case of openlogicalchannel for media control (RTCP/odd) port,
h245 address in the packet is wrongly modified to have an even port.

I am attaching a pcap demonstrating the problem, for any further analysis.

This behavior was introduced around v2.6.19 while rewriting the helper.
