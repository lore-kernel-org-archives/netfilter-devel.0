Thanks for reviewing this. I think my comment on the patch was
misleading, we do give preference to copy_range and that is what we
default to. --nflog-range will not override the per-instance default,
the only time it would get preference is when its value is lesser than
the per-instance value. If copy_range is lesser than --nflog-range then
we retain copy_range.

So basically what we are doing is min(copy_range, nflog-range). Just
wanted to clarify this, if this is not how it's meant to be please let
me know.

Also, there is a bug in my patch, li->u.ulog.copy_len can be set to "0"
from userspace (if --nflog-range is not specified), so we have to check
for this condition before using the value. I will send a V2 of the patch
based on your reply.

Thanks,
Vishwanath
