Now I understand your usecase. Restricting the size based on match
conditions sound reasonable to me.

Why don't you add a new userspace option, eg. --nflog-size, that
specifies this "further restrict" logic?

What I'm proposing is:

1) If --nflog-range is used, print a message telling: "--nflog-range
   has never worked, ignoring this option."

2) If --nflog-size is used, set the size in the structure that is
   passed to the kernel, and apply this "further restrict" logic.

3) Add the flag to the kernel that I suggested. This flag is only set
   via --nflog-size.

Just to clarify: What I'm trying to avoid is breaking the thing for
users that are using this --nflog-range (even if it doesn't work) and
then change the behaviour for them.

With the new option, we really validate that the user is exactly
asking for this "further restrict" logic that you need.

let me know, thanks.
