So could we perhaps solve all our problems by defining the generic version thusly:

void spin_unlock_wait(spinlock_t *lock)
{
	if (spin_trylock(lock))
		spin_unlock(lock);
}

... and perhaps rename it to spin_barrier() [or whatever proper name there would 
be]?

Architectures can still optimize it, to remove the small window where the lock is 
held locally - as long as the ordering is at least as strong as the generic 
version.

This would have various advantages:

 - semantics are well-defined

 - the generic implementation is already pretty well optimized (no spinning)

 - it would make it usable for the IPC performance optimization

 - architectures could still optimize it to eliminate the window where the lock is
   held locally - if there's such instructions available.

Was this proposed before, or am I missing something?

Thanks,

	Ingo
