Without reading any further (yet), that sounds like

Well of course. You want a personal firewall that asks the user,
it is going to involve userspace. Also because that is simpler
to implement and debug.

Thank the guys who removed the modular LSM interface.

Yes, but each LSM could decide whether it supports stacking of
another module after it (either by invoking that module or not
doing so at all).

My opinion up to here would be to split LSM into the LSM category
{selinux, apparmor, tomoyo} and the other, new LSM category
{networking stuff}, just as a potential idea to get over the
stacking / single LSM use  issue.

That is what cn_net should be doing, I hear. So ... hmhm *dribble*.

tuxguardian is probably regardable as obsoleted by cn_net (if it's
finished someday, or is it?) -- Samir probably knows more.
