Presumably then, your system rejected any incoming packet which was 
larger than the 576 byte MTU it got from the Comcast DHCP server..

I can think of two reasons for larger packets to be arriving at your 
system then:

1) UDP

2) Broken TCPs ass-u-me-ing a TCP MSS larger than 536 bytes when there 
wasn't an MSS option in the SYN(s).

Did your SuSE system send actual TCP MSS options based on the 576 byte MTU?
