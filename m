Ok, I tested DNAT'ing an IP multicast packet to the unicast MAC address
of the bridge interface.

Both ping-ing to an IPv4 and IPv6 multicast listener on br0 worked
and was replied to fine, both with or without changing skb->pkt_type
from PACKET_MULTICAST to PACKET_HOST.
("$ ping 224.1.0.123" and "$ ping6 ff02::1:ff40:707c%in0" from a
 network namespace, tied into the bridge via veth)

Also, a DNAT'ed PACKET_BROADCAST worked, with or without changing
it to PACKET_HOST.

I also checked via tcpdump that the destination MAC was changed
successfully.


So, so far I wasn't able to find any bugs with the current
patch. But I think I like the idea of leaving the skb->pkt_type
unaltered for PACKET_MULTICAST and PACKET_BROADCAST, seems cleaner.

I'd just add an "if (skb->pkt_type == PACKET_OTHERHOST)" check
then and resend a PATCH v2.
