Hi,

I m struck with
Kernel Panic - Out of Memory Issue  when  traffic  is more than 100k
pps  and have  around 10 tc rules.

There is NO kernel panic with 1 tc rule .

I using a 2.6.34.6 ( latest stable kernel) with SMP enabled

The rules are simple -
10 iptable rules :
iptables -t mangle -I FORWARD -s x.x.x.x  -j CLASSIFY --set-class 0xz:0xy

10 tc rules :
tc  class add dev imq0 parent 1:z classid 1:y htb rate 2kbit ceil 32768kbps

I m using  Intel Xeon Quad core x5570, 12GB RAM , with 8 e1000e , irq
affined ( 1 pair per core)

There is NO issue / CRASH with multiple iptable rules marking to the
same tc rule/HTB class , i can sucessfully pass more than 200k pps /
800Mbps traffic .

But when each iptable rule is marking to seprate tc rule/HTB class and
when the traffic exceeds 100K pps / 20000 connections per second , we
hit this Out of Memory - Kernel panic condition .
Any help is appreciated . Do let me know if any more further
information is need.

Thanks,
Anand
