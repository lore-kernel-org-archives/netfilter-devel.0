I'd vote for middlebox, e.g., some kind of TCP proxy, split TCP 
brokeness or misconfigured firewall or such (or perhaps it's just
because of some misguided one who have been thought that duplicate
ACKs are a serious threat :-))...

Yes, it wouldn't even be that hard to do with hping3. I might actually 
try to come up with something (but not now).

Ah, I just forgot that the situation might persist... Try with this 
one instead...

[PATCH] tcp FRTO: workaround dupACK-less receivers

FRTO assumes that dupACKs arrive in-order to fallback into
conventional recovery. Some receivers, due to unknown reasons,
care not to send duplicate ACKs at all, which seems quite
unreasonable because RFC2581 is using SHOULD for ofo segment
duplicate ACKs. ...A more likely cause might be some broken
middlebox which blocks dupACKs. If no duplicate ACKs arrive,
TCP goes into RTO-loop due to FRTO, because only new data is
getting sent after the retransmission of the head segment
(and its partial ACK). The situation continues until a big
cumulative ACK covers all outstanding data (or until somebody
gives up).

The new approach prevents reentry to FRTO when a previous FRTO
recovery is underway. This alone was found inadequate solution
because the situation may persist with some receivers even after
the first fallback has occured. Thus cover anything in CA_Loss
state too.

This impacts FRTO accuracy as we lose ability to detect more than
one spurious segment per window with NewReno. Performance impact
in real world is hard to estimate because it's hard to know how
often second RTO would be spurious in practice, however, the
worst case behavior will still be as without FRTO so it just
reduces the benefits of FRTO.

This issue was reported by Thomas Jarosch and probably a number
of other people (though there was other case which was a real
bug with similar symptoms that was fixed in 2.6.25.7).
