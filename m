Hi Dave,

the following patches contain my netfilter update for 2.6.37, containing:

- xtables and ebtables cleanups from Jan

- NAT cleanups and optimizations from Changli

- a fix for a race condition in netfilter hash random initialization and
  caching of the original hash value from the lookup for hash insertion
  from Changli

- smaller ctnetlink fixes and support for user-space connection tracking
  helpers from Pablo

- ctnetlink expectation deletion event notifications from Pablo

- a patch from Eric to make the LOG targets build the entire log string
  in a buffer before printing it to save some overhead and avoid having
  the log message intermixed with unrelated printks

- a TPROXY fix for dealing with TIME_WAIT sockets from Balazs

- a TPROXY fix for locking problems in __inet_inherit_port() from Balazs

- IPv6 TPROXY support from Balazs and Krisztian

- IPVS persistent engine core and SIP persistent engine from Simon

- IPVS IPv6 tunnel mode from Hans Schillstrom

- various IPVS fixes and optimizations from Julian

- IPVS support for local servers and clients from Julian
