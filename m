What about the use cases? I certainly like the idea you suggest in
your blog ("Ever dreamt to block all Linux users in your network
from accessing internet and allow full bandwidth to Windows worm?")
:) But something this easy to evade doesn't seem to provide a real
benefit for a firewall.

I can see that something like "Block IE6 running on Windows version X"
might be useful (NUFW can do this I think), but that needs support
from the host.

This would be preferrable in my opinion since they both allow
programmable filters, but u32 appears to be more flexible. I'm
very reluctant to add new iptables modules that don't increase
expressiveness or provide other clear benefits since we already
have an insane amount of modules.

 From the fingerprint file:

# Fingerprint entry format:
#
# wwww:ttt:D:ss:OOO...:OS:Version:Subtype:Details
#
# wwww     - window size (can be *, %nnn, Snn or Tnn).  The special values
#            "S" and "T" which are a multiple of MSS or a multiple of MTU
#            respectively.
# ttt      - initial TTL
# D        - don't fragment bit (0 - not set, 1 - set)
# ss       - overall SYN packet size
# OOO      - option value and order specification (see below)
# OS       - OS genre (Linux, Solaris, Windows)
# Version  - OS Version (2.0.27 on x86, etc)
# Subtype  - OS subtype or patchlevel (SP3, lo0)
# details  - Generic OS details

MSS can be matched using the tcpmss match, options (but not order)
using the tcp match, TTL using the ttl match, DF using the IP flags
match, packet size using the length match. That leaves WS for u32
(or adding support to the tcp match).

The conversion looks pretty easy actually.

Yes, I know.

I'm not sure if we want to, but they appear to provide similar
functionality and connector only has a single user in the tree
so far. But thats a different discussion, for netfilter related
things nfnetlink should be used.
