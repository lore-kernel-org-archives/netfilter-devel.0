If there is a DNAT in the way, this will jump to the very start of
the stack.  So if we have a hostile IPsec peer, and the DNAT rules
are such that this can occur, then we could be in trouble (especially
because policy/selector verification does not occur until all IPsec
has been done so we can't check inner address validitiy at this point).

Having the packets appear twice on AF_PACKET is probably desirable :)

I'll need to think about the double-parsing though.
