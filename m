It looks like we want to provide two ways to resolve this:

1) Walker holds ht->mutex the entire time to block out resizes.
   Optionally the walker can acquire all bucket locks. Such
   scenarios would seem to benefit from either a single or a very
   small number of bucket locks.

2) Walker holds ht->mutex during individual Netlink message
   construction periods and relases it while user space reads the
   message. rhashtable provides a hook which is called when a
   resize operation is scheduled allowing for the walker code to
   bump a sequence number and notify user space that the dump is
   inconsistent, causing it to request a new dump.

I'll provide an API to achieve (2). (1) is already achieveable with
the current API.
