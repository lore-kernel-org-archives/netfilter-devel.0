Always wanting small buffers doesn't make sense.  It seem that he is not 
considering that network equipment can be used for other things than 
TCP/IP.

What I want is a *smooth* IPTV multicast signal (which thus consumes 
minimal buffer space), but because the streamers are bursting packets, I 
want large enough buffers in the switch, to handle these bursts.

What I recommend (in the backbone) is to increase the buffer size in the 
QoS queue, which is used for e.g. IPTV/multicast.  And have another queue 
for the normal Internet traffic (because too large buffers can cause 
issues).

Our TV streamer send out a MULTICAST signal, thus there is NOT any
congestion feedback...

Skimming through Getty's blog post, I think Getty has actually missed what 
is happening.  He should read my masters thesis[1]... The real problem is 
that TCP/IP is clocked by the ACK packets, and on asymetric links (like 
ADSL and DOCSIS), the ACK packets are simply comming downstream too fast 
on the larger downstream link, resulting in bursts and high-latency on the 
upstream link.

With the ADSL-optimizer I actually solved Gettys problem, but I guess the 
real solution would be to implement a TCP algorithm which handels this 
asymmtry, and e.g. isn't based on the ACK feedback...
