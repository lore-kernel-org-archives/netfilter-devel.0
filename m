Good, trick.  I'll use that.

No, not using hotplug CPUs.  Its just a pitty that we waste kernel
memory on this, for every one which does not know the "maxcpus=3D16
possible_cpus=3D16" trick...

But as I don't have a hotplug CPU system, I have no chance of testing a=
n
eventual code fix/patch.

In my case I think this will not help. I'll kill the cache anyways, as
the ruleset is 19MB and my CPU cache is 8MB.
