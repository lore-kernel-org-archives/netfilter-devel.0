Definitely right.

Well, no.  conntrack should just forward even uncompleted fragments
to next process (e.g. core ipv6 code), and then the core would send
ICMP error back.  ICMP should be sent by the core ipv6 code according
to decision of itself, not according to netfilter.

It should never be sent by the decision of the netfilter because
the semantics and code paths are different in two cases.

I mean, netfilter conntrack should not either drop or modify any
packets, and it should not generate any additional packets.

Would you please explain more about what you mean by consistency
between IPv4 and IPv6 conntrack?

I do think it is rather different, anyway (because original packets
is to be preserved in IPv6, but not in IPv4).
