I don't think we should be adding code specifically needed for netfilter
to the loopback driver if we can avoid it. I don't think we need to
actually avoid calling nf_nat_packet twice, that shouldn't do any harm,
just the sequence number adjustment. So we could add the loopback check
to the IPS_SEQ_ADJUST_BIT case to at least avoid it in some cases.
Would that work or am I missing something?
