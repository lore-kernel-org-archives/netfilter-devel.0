We certainly can, and in fact the packet would get fragmented
by the IP layer in case we would exceed the PMTU. Additionally
we currently check that the packet contains no data, even with
the first version of this patch, so there's no way the packet
could exceed the MTU.

This feature has been there from day one since the TCPMSS target
has been merged and people are using this with knowledge of their
MTUs to work around broken ISPs. I'm not apply this.

The first version seemed fine to me though :)
