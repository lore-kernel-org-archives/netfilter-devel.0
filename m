There is no agreed-upon definition of spin_unlock_wait()'s semantics,
and it appears that all callers could do just as well with a lock/unlock
pair.  This commit therefore removes spin_unlock_wait() and related
definitions from core code.

- * Various notes on spin_is_locked() and spin_unlock_wait(), which are
- * 'interesting' functions:
- *
- * PROBLEM: some architectures have an interesting issue with atomic ACQUIRE
- * operations in that the ACQUIRE applies to the LOAD _not_ the STORE (ARM64,
- * PPC). Also qspinlock has a similar issue per construction, the setting of
- * the locked byte can be unordered acquiring the lock proper.
- *
- * This gets to be 'interesting' in the following cases, where the /should/s
- * end up false because of this issue.
- *
- *
- * CASE 1:
- *
- * So the spin_is_locked() correctness issue comes from something like:
- *
- *   CPU0				CPU1
- *
- *   global_lock();			local_lock(i)
- *     spin_lock(&G)			  spin_lock(&L[i])
- *     for (i)				  if (!spin_is_locked(&G)) {
- *       spin_unlock_wait(&L[i]);	    smp_acquire__after_ctrl_dep();
- *					    return;
- *					  }
- *					  // deal with fail
- *
- * Where it is important CPU1 sees G locked or CPU0 sees L[i] locked such
- * that there is exclusion between the two critical sections.
- *
- * The load from spin_is_locked(&G) /should/ be constrained by the ACQUIRE from
- * spin_lock(&L[i]), and similarly the load(s) from spin_unlock_wait(&L[i])
- * /should/ be constrained by the ACQUIRE from spin_lock(&G).
- *
- * Similarly, later stuff is constrained by the ACQUIRE from CTRL+RMB.
- *
- *
- * CASE 2:
- *
- * For spin_unlock_wait() there is a second correctness issue, namely:
- *
- *   CPU0				CPU1
- *
- *   flag = set;
- *   smp_mb();				spin_lock(&l)
- *   spin_unlock_wait(&l);		if (!flag)
- *					  // add to lockless list
- *					spin_unlock(&l);
- *   // iterate lockless list
- *
- * Which wants to ensure that CPU1 will stop adding bits to the list and CPU0
- * will observe the last entry on the list (if spin_unlock_wait() had ACQUIRE
- * semantics etc..)
- *
- * Where flag /should/ be ordered against the locked store of l.
- */
-
-/*
- * queued_spin_lock_slowpath() can (load-)ACQUIRE the lock before
- * issuing an _unordered_ store to set _Q_LOCKED_VAL.
- *
- * This means that the store can be delayed, but no later than the
- * store-release from the unlock. This means that simply observing
- * _Q_LOCKED_VAL is not sufficient to determine if the lock is acquired.
- *
- * There are two paths that can issue the unordered store:
- *
- *  (1) clear_pending_set_locked():	*,1,0 -> *,0,1
- *
- *  (2) set_locked():			t,0,0 -> t,0,1 ; t != 0
- *      atomic_cmpxchg_relaxed():	t,0,0 -> 0,0,1
- *
- * However, in both cases we have other !0 state we've set before to queue
- * ourseves:
- *
- * For (1) we have the atomic_cmpxchg_acquire() that set _Q_PENDING_VAL, our
- * load is constrained by that ACQUIRE to not pass before that, and thus must
- * observe the store.
- *
- * For (2) we have a more intersting scenario. We enqueue ourselves using
- * xchg_tail(), which ends up being a RELEASE. This in itself is not
- * sufficient, however that is followed by an smp_cond_acquire() on the same
- * word, giving a RELEASE->ACQUIRE ordering. This again constrains our load and
- * guarantees we must observe that store.
- *
- * Therefore both cases have other !0 state that is observable before the
- * unordered locked byte store comes through. This means we can use that to
- * wait for the lock store, and then wait for an unlock.
