I am not sure the struct was ordered for optimized cacheline performance
beforehand either.

* par->in, par->out is only rarely used (think of xt_physdev, besides
  ipt_do_table itself);
* par->match similarly (xt_hashlimit)
* par->matchinfo, though showing more grep results, is usually copied to
  the stack by means of struct foo_target_info *info = par->matchinfo;
etc.
