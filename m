I think double entries are not a problem, as you say, there
are already other cases where this can happen. But I think we
should try our best that every entry present at the start and
still present at the end of a dump is also contained in the
dump, otherwise the guantees seem to weak to still be useful.
Your first proposal would do exactly that, right?

Thats true. But its a very rare operation, so I think its mainly
a documentation issue.
