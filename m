Good point, after all, I think structs have been used too often
and we now suffer from backwards compatbility issues. The
points likely to be argueable are things like trim responsibility
in the error handling, i.e. delegate it down to the function
which also created the header or trim on every level. Other than
that the whole thing should be pretty straight forward.

What do you think about naming it nlattr?
