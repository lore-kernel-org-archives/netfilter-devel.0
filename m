My point was that if you hold reference counts to the module users
will need to manually flush conntrack table (or at least manually
remove affected connections), else rmmod won't work as refcount might be
gt 0.

*shrug*, I did not write this stuff.

Historically it wasn't needed because we just clear out the helper area
in the affected conntracks (i.e, future packets are not inspected by
the helper anymore).

When conntracks were made per-netns this problem was added as we're not
guaranteed to see all net namespace because module_exit and netns cleanup
can run concurrently.

We can still use the "old" model if we guarantee that we wait for
netns cleanup to finish (which is what this patch does).

The alternative, as you pointed out, is to take a module reference for
each conntrack that uses the helper (and put again when connection is
destroyed).

I don't really care that much except that if we go for the latter
solution users cannot "just rmmod" the module anymore but might have
to manually remove the affected connections first.

Pablo, I can rework things to do module get/put but I ask for explicit
instructions to do so (I prefer the "barrier" approach).
