But it cannot be used for personal firewalls at this time.
Incoming packets have no process context because they are
processed before that is determined, and similarly,
outgoing packets have already left most of the process
context behind them. Additionally, Netfilter cannot reject
bind() calls *at all*. That is the reason this is done
as an LSM in the first place.
