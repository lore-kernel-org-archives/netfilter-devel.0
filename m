Kris already provided you with the results for 2.6.24, behaviour there seems to have become even worse. 

But about your first remark:
The ubuntu 2.6.22-14 kernel has that message still, it's based on kernel version 2.6.22.9 and I downloaded the original from kernel.org, and that still contains the message:
linux-2.6.22.9/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_proto_tcp.c at line 909 in function tcp_packet.

I also compared with the 2.6.17.1 (which is definitely older than the ubuntu 2.6.17), and the function tcp_packet has not changed between these versions. In 2.6.25 this function did have some changes though. So the relevant change causing the behaviour must be outside function tcp_packet.
