While looking into what it would take to route packets out to network
devices in other network namespaces I started looking at the netfilter
hooks, and there is a lot of nasty code to figure out which network
namespace to filter the packets in.

Passing the network namespace into the netfilter hooks is a significant
simplication in the code, and worth it as the first thing most netfilter
hooks do is compute the network namespace.

I collided with Pablos work on per network namespace netfilter hooks
the first time I submitted his changes, so now this patchset includes
a per network namespace nftable hooks.  Inspired by Pablos work but
largely rewritten to fix and avoid the bugs I was finding in Pablos
work to register the netfilter hooks per network namespace.

These per network namespace netfilter hooks fix a long standing bug in
nftables, where packets passing through nftables would be run against
the nftables configuration of every network namespace.

I have noticed what appears to be one more bug in nftables.  Today the
nf_queue code takes a module reference count to prevent the netfilter
hook that it stops at from being unregistered.  As it is the module
initialization and module cleanup code that call nf_unregister_hook[s]
in everything but nftables this works.  Unfortunately it appears that
someone can cause a packet to be queued, delete the nftable chain that
caused the queueing and then cause the packet to be reinjected.  So it
looks like nfqnl_rcv_dev_event is needed for netfilter hook
unregistration.

The first group of changes roots out all of the very weird network
namespace computation logic (except for the code in ipvs) and fixes it.
I really don't like how the code has been essentially guessing which
network namespace to use.

Probably the worst guessing is in ipvs in the function skb_net. I have
some preliminary changes to fix ipvs but they are not quite ready yet.
Cleaning up ipvs enough that I can kill skb_net is on my short list.

There are a few extra cleanups in the first group of changes sprinkled
in as I noticed a few other things as I was sorting out the network
namespace computation logic.

There rest of the changes are based on Pablos per network namespace
netfilter hook work and include related cleanups and simplifications.
The most non-obvious detail were the necessary header file cleanups.

The changes where I started with Pablos patches in some cases the
credits get a little weird and the descriptions are a little weaker than
I would like but overall I think it is all close enough.
