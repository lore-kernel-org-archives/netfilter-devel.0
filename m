Good point Jan.

However, we're in inconsistent state now and removing interfaces is
not easy / fast.

So I think we have to fix it first and then, if we decide to do so,
deprecate them.

It seems to me like a good idea to target to providing netlink
interfaces for all netfilter tweaks and use iptables (or whatsoever.
command line tool we'll have in the future) to attach specific
configurations to flow.

Thus, having no more sysctl stuff and module parameters tweaks.
