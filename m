On eth1.100 internal ip address 169.254.16.1  is configured and on eth1.101 internal ip address 169.254.16.2 is configured.

However, when ep2 sends a packet, it seems that the conntrack entry matches it and the ip table NAT rule (which should map this packet to 169.254.16.2) is ignored and because of the 4-tuple match with existing udp conntrack entry, the packet is sent to 169.254.16.1.

There is a patch to do something pretty similar:

http://candelatech.com/oss/conntrack_mark_with_ssyctl.patch

It allows to set default skb mark values per device and
uses those as additional key for conntrack lookups.
