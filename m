Thanks for your quick reply, Dave.

and it apparently happens in a lot of 'typical' setups where you have a
masqueraded DSL line with dynamic ip address for bulk traffic, and
fwmark-based routing through one or more tunnel interfaces, optionally
with different masqerading/SNAT.

Also, the MASQUERADE lookup (obviously) has no more saddr in the lookup,
that's another difference from the 'original' lookup.

Thanks Dave, I did look up the bk web interface on this item before sending
this post ;) However

does not really give me an understanding of why and where it might screw
up. I really want  to fully understand this issue before proposing any
change.

That is the presumption I am about to challenge.  Is the 'original'
interface really the one we want in this case?=20

I've seen a number of users commenting out that check or even starting
to use the iptables ROUTE target (ugly) to get it working in their
setup.  Or they start to use SNAT with scripts in PPP if-up to update
the ruleset with the new dynamic IP :(
