We have the __ functions for that purpose. __this_cpu_inc f.e. falls back
to a simply ++ operation if the arch cannot provide something better.
irqsafe_xx are only used if the context does not provide any protection
and if there is the potential of the counter being incremented from an
interrupt context.
