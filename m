Yes, it is different.

As you know, defragment can not happen on routers in IPv6.
Because we do want to preserve hop-by-hop option etc,
we preserve original packets in netfilter code.

In IPv6, defragment in netfilter is a temporary just
for conntrack.  The state (including defragmented packet)
is not preserved, and original fragments are used in further
process (including local processing or forwarding).

So, please take that defragment failure is same as other
random reasons what netfilter code thinks.  Of course,
you can introduce nf-specific counters that show reasons
why packets are discarded in netfilter module.

Please make it optional (via parameter) at least.
