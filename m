If we drop the reentrancy thing, what should work is to prevent
using loopback as output device and using something similar to
the recursion counters tunnel devices used to have.

Yes, basically. Although I believe the selinux people would be
happier if you kept the original secmark for the copied packets :)

I guess pskb_copy() would be most optimal since we can modify
the header, but the non-linear area could be shared
