I've taken this round for a spin on the 32-core setup.  I'd not previously 
applied Patrick's patches to remove the initialization, so my kludges to compile 
may have altered things, but assuming it was OK (convert the inits to 
__MUTEX_INITIALIZER to make the compiler happy) it appears that this change does 
very good things indeed for the "empty" case.  Where the 
2.6.29-rc2/unpatchednet-next showed a 50% drop (handwaving math) in the "empty" 
case compared to the "none" case (aka none is no iptables modules loaded, empty 
being what one gets after iptables --list) this patch shows what appears to be a 
much much smaller drop of less than 6%.

The original data can be seen at:

ftp://ftp.netperf.org/iptable_scaling/  in no_iptables and empty_iptables

and the data after this patch can be seen at:

ftp://ftp.netperf.org/hemminger/hemminger6/  in none and empty

while I have none of Eric's patches in this tree, just for grins I went ahead and 
ran "full" as well.

happy benchmarking,
