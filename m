Indeed, I have missed that spot. I'm not very familiar with that code,
however, I see that the creation of a state depends on the netlink
broadcast return value, but how useful is that? I think that the state
should be created even if the broadcast fails, the userspace daemon
should request a resync to the kernel as soon as it hits ENOBUFS, then
it would be in sync again with that state.
