We have to keep the existing behaviour. Yes, it's broken or ambiguos
but there may be people outthere relying on this.

What I think we can do to resolve this scenario that you describe
abobe is to provide a new option:

        --hashlimit-exclusive

this turns on a flag in the configuration that results in a bail out
if any of these two happens:

1) there is an existing hashlimit with that name already.
2) someone tries to add a hashlimit with a clashing name with no
   --hashlimit-exclusive.

So the --hashlimit-exclusive just makes sure the user gets a unique
name and silly things don't happen.

If not specified, we rely on the existing (broken) behaviour.

For this case, you rename your enhance-proc option to:

        --hashlimit-update

as I proposed, and remove the /proc entry rename logic.

With the explicit new options, we can indeed know where to go. If no
options are specified, we just keep behaving in the same (broken) way
that we provide now.

This is the way hashlimit has been working since day one

Does this sound good to you?

Thanks for not giving up on sorting out this problem.
