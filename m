	The idea is good. But code that caches dsts should
also handle at least NETDEV_UNREGISTER (NETDEV_DOWN being
another option) to release dsts. Holding dsts for frozen
conns in EST state for long time is a problem. IIRC, such dsts
are not under dst_dev_event() control. nf_nat_masquerade_ipv4.c
has something like this but for masq_index.
