Yes, we end up with just one rule, but the kernel data structure is not
updated. Userspace thinks the value is 300/s but in the kernel it is
still 200/s.

Yes, I believe you had a discussion about this with Josh Hunt. This
patch does add a new option, but it is called -enhanced-procfs instead.
I am open to renaming this to something else. I chose this name because
this patch will affect the names of the procfs files when multiple rules
with the same name exist. This generally does not happen, but is a side
effect of the way we create these files. In the case of restore example
above - we get the call to "hashlimit_mt_check" for the new rule before
the old rule is deleted, so there is a short window where we have two
rules in the kernel with the same name.

Other than that, we are doing exactly what you said, but creating a new
entry in the hashtable instead of updating it. The previous entry will
automatically be removed when the old rule is flushed/deleted.

Users will see this new behavior only if the new option is passed,
otherwise we default to the old behavior. We are also doing this in rev2
so old userspace tools will not be affected.

Thanks,
Vishwanath
