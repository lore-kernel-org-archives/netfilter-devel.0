Agreed on the transparent part, however I consider silently dropping
packets not transparent. In fact conntrack itself should never drop
packets except under some very special circumstances when there's
no other choice in order to operate correctly. Dropping packets is
supposed to be a policy decision made by the user.

In this case without conntrack, IPv6 would send an ICMPv6 message,
so in my opinion the transparent thing to do would be to still send
them. Of course only if reassembly is done on an end host.

There's really no difference in sending these packets from conntrack
compared to passing the incomplete fragments upwards to IPv6 and
waiting for another timeout, except that its easier to implement
consistently by generating the packets within conntrack.

It really depends on what you define as "transparent".

Please see above for my reasoning. There's also the matter of consisten=
cy
between IPv4 and IPv6 conntrack.
