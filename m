This is by design.  Netfilter looks at full TSO frames, but the
TSO hardware in the cards do not interpret the TCP options in any
way whatsoever when splitting the TSO packet up into MSS frames,
they just copy the options as-is into each sub-frame.

Once you add MD5 checksums to the TCP packet, TSO can no longer be
used on that path, so you'll have to disable TSO either in the route
or via some other means.
