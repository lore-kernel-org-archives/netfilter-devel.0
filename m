This kind of usage requires static interface names. But there are=20
dynamic interfaces such as ppp, where the actual name is not always=20
known or sometimes they exist sometimes not. It is difficult to use=20
iptables this way, and every ifup/ifdown requires change in the iptable=
s=20
ruleset (donwload it, modify and upload to the kernel). It may be too s=
low.
