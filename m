Do you see a way forward where the new behavior could be enabled f.e.
as an extra mount option (that long-term would be made default, while
deprecating the current behavior) on net_cls et al? There are various
more users at least on the net_cls side (nft and tc as well). Would be
really great, if sk_cgroup could abstract that somehow away for all of
them w/o adding a second version to all users.

Best,
Daniel
