Sorry, I re-used the analysis from before that change went in. I now
have an oops report from 2.6.23.14 on x86_64.

It is oopsing there, and only on x86_64 now, because x86_64 refuses to
use a non-canonical address. ct contains what appears to be ASCII data.
i386 might be dereferencing some random address instead of oopsing...


   0:   48 f7 45 78 80 01 00    testq  $0x180,0x78(%rbp)
   7:   00
   8:   74 4c                   je     0x56
   a:   48 c7 c7 e0 18 28 88    mov    $0xffffffff882818e0,%rdi

%rbp has a bogus (non-canonical) address. On i386 there is no such test possible
so it will just dereference the address if it is mapped.

%rbp contains 8 valid ASCII chars: "salcf x\"
