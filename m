Yeah, I messed with procfs handlers.

Yup, it is safe on UP machine, since without lock it is only accessed
from the bottom half, which is disabled, but running it on different CPU
will lead to crash.

procfs was not a very good choice here :)

Just to be sure, that  return from the call does update the list.
It is not needed in practice.

Procfs was messed, it should use proper rcu freeing path, and although
procefs entry was removed, there may be some reference.

Thanks a lot for your review Paul.
