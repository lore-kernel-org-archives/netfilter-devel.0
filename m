Code size can have some visible performance impact too.

But either way, what you say only means that ctors are not necessary
significantly faster. But your original point was that they are
slower.
If they are not slower, then what Andrey said seems to make sense:
some gain on code comprehension front re type-stability invariant +
some gain on performance front (even if not too big) and no downsides.
