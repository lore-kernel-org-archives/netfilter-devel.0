I'm evolving to think that it would be good to have a single entry
point for ingress filtering.

But where are the barriers? These unfounded performance claims are
simply absurd, qdisc ingress barely performs a bit better just because
it executes a bit less code and only in the single CPU scenario with
no rules at all.
