Yes, I'm pretty certain about that: The 11d5f15723c9 patch that introduced this
kept the existing implementation for the revision==1 case, except for changing
the types.

Ok, fair enough. I couldn't tell how much of a fast path this
was, and it's more a general issue that I see with other developers
blindly using div_u64() whenever getting this link error.

Since I already had the patch by the time I saw the other one
(which is also at v3 and got comments), I just sent it out along
with the other two patches I had for netfilter.

I also ended up introducing a typo in a last-minute change, so I'll let
Vishwanath and you work out the best implementation and withdraw my
version.
