Yes, we should move the contid_list assignment below the aunet check.
At this point, testing has revlealed that audit_netns_contid_del() is
being called very infrequently (very early) with invalid net or aunet
which is why its code has been re-arranged to safeguard against it.  So
far, audit_netns_contid_add() has not had this problem, but I'd feel
safer leaving the check in and to make that check relevant (rather than
the contid_list assignment panicing) I'll move that assignment.

Yes, you appear to be correct.  The examples in auditfilter.c and
auditsc.c are stale since the original optimizations they were
protecting are no longer present, but the practice was copied by several
maintainers since.  I'll fix this and address the others seperately.

I'm sure we could find extreme use cases in both directions.  One
extreme is one task per container.  The other extreme is a distro
container where all processes for an entire O/S running in a container
just use the refcount.  The former seems more likely at this point.  We
break even at two tasks per container.

I'm willing to switch this over to alloc/dealloc and use GFP_KERNEL
which will inevitably make some kernel maintainers happier and others
cringe.  This could be a good candidate for kmem_cache since it is a
fixed size.

Switching to GFP_KERNEL is certainly preferable.  None of the callers
will have a problem with that.

I see enough examples without that suggest it isn't necessary.  I'll
remove it.
