The driver was ensure_mtu_is_adequate where in one half
of the function we have skb_net another half we have 
dev_net(dst_skb(skb)->dev).    That is goofy.

That gets replaced by ip_vs_conn_net(cp).

In practice today I don't see that there are differences in
network namespaces today.

Moving forward I hope to be able to route packets out to network devices
in different network namespaces. It is a massive optimization that
doesn't need much code to support.  Once that optimization is in place
deriving the network namespace from the output device will not work.

I believe using ip_vs_conn_net(cp) is a simple rule that is easy to
understand and easy to implement correctly on the output path.
