Ok , i was tying to keepthe discussion to the mainline kernel :)
By sfq i mean esfq [though i read somewhere sfq will implement a way
to hash by src / dest ip] , or wrr :)
Actually i was never able to find out why wrr is not in mainline
kernel. In my opinion it is the best round robin qdisc i have ever
used.
