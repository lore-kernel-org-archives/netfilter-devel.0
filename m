I think it is very much required to have such a flag.  (we can actually
add it to the nfnetlink_log flags).  It really depends on your setup.
Some people really really want to have logging reliable, others fear
that they might easily be DoS'ed, if logging has higher priority than
packet forwarding.

If it's optional (and the default is unreliable), then I think it's a
great idea.
