	You should post first patch separately, not as a part
from the patchset, by specifying the tree:

[PATCH v4 net] ipvs: ...

	The other 3 patches remain in this patchset,
with added "net-next":

[PATCH v4 net-next */3] ipvs: ...

Patch 1:

	It is good to mention that problem happens for link-local
addresses, not for site/org-local or global scope. By this way
we are more precise when creating a bugfix, it avoids confusion.
You can also check again the Subject and the commit message for
improvements. It is up to you but here is an example:

ipvs: fix bind to link-local mcast IPv6 address in backup

	The empty line between Fixes and Signed-off-by should be
removed.

Patch 2-3: look OK

Patch 4:

	Some of the fields are unsigned, so %d should be %u:
sync_maxlen, mcast_port, mcast_af, mcast_ttl
