I think that's a problem that's unrelated to netfilter. Its quite easy
to configure something that will make the network stack eat up all
the CPU, consider f.i.:

bridge name	bridge id		STP enabled	interfaces
br0		8000.625dda62a3d4	no		veth0
							veth1

Now thing of bridging, veth, TC actions, iptables, routing, all in
combination. Sure, single cases can be caught it might be possible
to restrict them, but I don't believe that in the near term we will
be able to handle this properly.

And even if all loops etc are handled, what keeps the user from
creating a million veth devices and putting them into a long
chain?

This needs to be fixed on a different level in my opinion.
