An entry can move between different tables and thus chains need to be
marked to identify what list a lookup ended up searching in. It's not
the nulls marker itself that is needed, it's the bits in the last next
pointer identifying the list that the nulls marker allows to be used
which are essential.

This is on my plate next. Most of the work in rhashtable was done in
preparation of translating the TCP established table over to
rhashtable.
