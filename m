[Only some general comments without having looked at the
code in detail]

My two main objections are that this only works for TCP and
can be trivially evaded. What use cases does it have?
I'm also wondering whether this couldn't be implemented
using the u32 match.

And I don't think it should be using connector. AFAIK we
only have a single user in the tree currently and new
stuff usually uses genetlink (which is pretty similar),
so we might be able to remove connection in the future
unless we add new users. But netfilter modules should
use nfnetlink anyway.
