Jan, I would actually like to maintain the source via my own git tree. 
And I would gladly accept your patches against that tree.

Since the workshop, I have been busy "Open Sourcing" the project my self. 
I now have a git repository, which also contains the collector daemon, 
web-code and database layout.  The git tree also contains some README 
documentation.  It for example contains a description of howto setup a 
testlab with MPEG2 streaming via VLC and controlled packet drops via 
tc-netem, so you can perform your runtime tests.

I didn't plan to release the project just yet, as I wanted to do some 
renaming.  E.g I want to rename the mp2t module to mpeg2ts, and I want to 
rename the collector daemon from tvprobe to iptv-analyzer.

The git tree is temporarily located on people.netfilter.org:

  git://people.netfilter.org/hawk/iptv-analyzer.git

I have bought the domain iptv-analyzer.org, but I have not installed any 
servers on that domain, yet.

Solvik Blum (Cc.ed), is currently helping me out with the web-frontend.

Cheers,
   Jesper Brouer
