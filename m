First draft of proper fix:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/2/7/89

Will fix review comments from David Miller soon and I need to figure out
how to get the needed fixes to the glibc side too.

The problem from my point of view is that kernel uapi header files have
incomplete dependencies, which were hiding kernel uapi and glibc header file
conflicts.

I will try to systematically fix the kernel uapi and glibc header conflicts
but this will take some time. If you want, you can hide the problem
by reverting the needed header file dependency fixes.
