Yeah, I'm not actually sure the old linked list implementation is
buggy - it might just be ugly. I tried to follow the old code, and I
couldn't.

So the patch I sent out was a combination of "that's not how you
should do singly linked lists" and "those special cases make me
worry". In particular, the old code really ended up doing odd things
in the "can't find entry" case, because it would exit the loop with a
non-NULL 'entry' just because the next entry was NULL..

That is certainly one possible explanation for it, yes. However, I
didn't think that part had changed, had it?

The other thing I find a bit odd in that new single-linked list code is this:

 - nf_hook_slow():
        ...
        RCU_INIT_POINTER(state->hook_entries, entry);

which makes me worried..  It copies the head entry of the list, and
maybe it will then (later) end up being used stale. I don't know. But
it looks a bit iffy.
