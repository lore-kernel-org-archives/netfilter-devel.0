I'd suggest you get 1-6, then I'll pull this info my tree. Thanks David!

Regarding #7, I have a couple two concerns:

1) cgroup currently doesn't work the way users expect, ie. to perform any
   reasonable firewalling. Since this relies on early demux, only a
   limited number of sockets get access to the cgroup info.

2) We have traditionally rejected match2 and target2 extensions. I
   guess you can accomodate the new cgroup code through the revision
   iptables infrastructure, so we still use the cgroup match.

Let me know, thanks.
