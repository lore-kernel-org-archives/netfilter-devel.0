Pablo,

I don't think you understand the scope of BPF.
'struct module *'? to attach nft to sockets? ouch.
if you need to do it, go ahead, but please don't present such mess
as a 'generic' infra.
What you're proposing won't work even for classic bpf.
'struct sock *' and 'struct module *' are totally redundant and won't
work for seccomp, tracing and pretty much everything, but pure
socket filtering.
Somehow you think that 'struct sk_filter' is only used in sockets.
That is not the case. Just grep the git.
and arguing that 'struct sk_filter' needs to be generalized for nft
is shortsighted as minimum.
Every piece of code that is using 'struct sk_filter' knows that it's
dealing with bpf/ebpf, so renaming is not changing the facts,
but rather stating the obvious and making code easier to
understand.

yes, please do introduce modules for nft only, since it doesn't
make sense for sockets and for bpf.

sorry Pablo, I don't think you understand what you're talking about.
refcnt and rcu_head are key parts of bpf/ebpf infra.
Programs are refcnt'ed not only by charging sockets. BPF is relying
on rcu for safe execution as well.
For example see my tracing filter patch that does:
void trace_filter_call_bpf(struct event_filter *filter, void *ctx)
{
        rcu_read_lock();
        SK_RUN_FILTER(filter->prog, ctx);
        rcu_read_unlock();
}
One eBPF program can be attached to multiple 'events' where event
is kprobe, tracepoint, syscall, etc The act of attaching increments
'struct sk_filter/bpf_prog -> refcnt'.
Every field of 'struct sk_filter' is used by BPF infra (including 'len'
and 'work') This struct is a definition of bpf program.
Seriously if you want to understand, just ask, but objecting due to
lack of understanding just silly.
