Fair enough.  We lose frag_max_size information from ipv4 defrag,
plus netfilter hooks are called without validating ip options.

The former has not worked ever with bridge, and the latter
evidentily isn't a problem either since this has not worked at all
for three years...

So I am fine with it, provided we rename br_parse_ip_options() --
thats not what it does after this patch (br_validate_iphdr(), for
example?)

Ok, fair enough.

Thanks Herbert.
