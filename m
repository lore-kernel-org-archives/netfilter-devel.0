Please do not send html messages : Your reply did not reach the lists.

Then, all you mention could have been solved by proper userspace
support.

Every time you add an interface or change device name, you could change
firewalls rules if needed. Nothing shocking here.

The ruleset can indeed mention interface names, but the kernel part
really should not care about names, which are a 'human' convenient way
to represent things.
