Right, I suggest adding a function pointer to rhashtable_params,
which when set, is called on resize so users can bump their own
sequence counter on resize.

Resize operations should be *really* rare as well unless you start
with really small hash table sizes and constantly add/remove at the
watermark.

Re-dumping on insert/remove is a different story of course. Do you
care about missed insert/removals for dumps? If not we can do the
sequence number consistency checking for resizing only.
