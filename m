Hrm.  Guess there must've been some other change in -next that pulled
the header in implicitly here :(

This can be a bit problematic for build (or widespread boot) breaks in
common configs since it takes out all the automated runtime testing that
people have running for the time the build break is in place.  In this
case it was just allmodconfig so it doesn't really get non-build testing
and makes little difference but for defconfigs it can be a more
substantial impact.  Applying fixes locally doesn't really work for this
case.

Great, thanks.
