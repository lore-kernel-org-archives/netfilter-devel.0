This was my plan. Thanks for the pointer!

I understand your concerns but an application which is able to parse positive
and negative numbers can also parse pure positives.
Just made a small test application, glibc's %d in sscanf() can also deal with UINT_MAX.
And I don't expect that applications to check whether the returned values from
/proc/net/netfilter/nfnetlink_queue are between INT_MIN and INT_MAX.

That said, I'd have assumed that an user would report negative values as plain kernel bug.

Thanks,
