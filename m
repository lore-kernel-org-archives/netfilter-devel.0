So I've been reviewing this patch and it looks fine, but I also want
to figure out what is actually causing the OOPS and I can't spot it
yet.

One possible way to see that oops is to free the head entry of the
chain without unlinking it.  The next unregister will dereference a
POISON pointer.

Actually...

The POISON value comes not from a hook entry, but from the array of
pointers in the per-netns datastructure.

This means that the netns is possibly getting freed up before we
unregister the netfilter hooks.
