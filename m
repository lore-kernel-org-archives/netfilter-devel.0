I must say I am surprised.

There already exists a maintained xt_TARPIT in Xtables-addons, and
it seems like your patch is a duplicate effort of it.

If you have any updates to xt_TARPIT, I would recommend the strategy
that Luciano Coelho used when he wanted to have xt_condition in
the main kernel:

1. take the maintained version from Xt-a
2. submit any updates to the Xt-a file, if feasible
3. once processed, submit that then for Linux kernel inclusion
4. apply further updates to the LK file, if needed

That way it is way easier to know what specifically new features you 
have added to xt_TARPIT, if any.


thanks,
Jan
