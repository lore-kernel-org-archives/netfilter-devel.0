I definitely agree with that :)

However, I'd really like to get these primitives in first so that
at least I can convert the existing rhashtable walkers over and
get on with implementing rhashtable rehashing which is what I set
out to do.

As otherwise we'd be looking at fixing the existing users (in
particular, nft_hash) properly which might take a lot more time.

If and when we finally fix the existing users we can always remove
these primitives.

FWIW when I first wrote this patch I called it
rhashtable_walk_dangerously, I can readopt that name if you think
that will dissuade people from using it.

Thanks,
