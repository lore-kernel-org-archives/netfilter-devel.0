I don't understand. GC_MAX_BUCKETS is the upper bound and I agree that it is
needed. But why GC_MAX_BUCKETS_DIV (ie 1/64)?
In other words, why this line:
goal = min(nf_conntrack_htable_size / GC_MAX_BUCKETS_DIV, GC_MAX_BUCKETS);
instead of:
goal = GC_MAX_BUCKETS;
?

Sure, but this is not a "real" solution, just a workaround.
We need to find a way to deliver conntrack deletion events in a reasonable
delay, whatever the traffic on the machine is.
