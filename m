That might make it unnessarily complicated to use src-based routing
when using TEE. I guess you'd usually have a host for logging or IDS
somewhere on a private network and TEE packets there. So specifying
oif and gateway seems most useful to me.

Yeah, but currently it does allow packets to be looped back. These
packets will also go through the netfilter hooks again.
