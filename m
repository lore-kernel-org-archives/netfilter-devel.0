	I reviewed the patchset. Nice work, thanks!
Here are some comments:

01/84 ipvs: Hoist computation of ipvs earlier in sctp_conn_schedule

	Simon had a fix for this problem, not sure what happened,
may be it was lost...

04/84 ipvs: Store ipvs not net in struct ip_vs_conn

	Lost '!' here:

@@ -359,7 +359,7 @@ struct ip_vs_conn *ip_vs_ct_in_get(const struct
ip_vs_conn_param *p)
 
        hlist_for_each_entry_rcu(cp, &ip_vs_conn_tab[hash], c_list) {
                if (unlikely(p->pe_data && p->pe->ct_match)) {
-                       if (!ip_vs_conn_net_eq(cp, p->net))
+                       if (net_eq(cp->ipvs->net, p->net))
                                continue;

	Problem is then propagated to patch 05/84:

-                       if (net_eq(cp->ipvs->net, p->net))
+                       if (cp->ipvs == p->ipvs)

26/84 ipvs: Pass ipvs not net to __ip_vs_get_servie_entries

	Missing 'c' in Subject

55/84 ipvs: Pass ipvs not net to register_ip_vs_app and 
unregister_ip_vs_app

	Empty line after ipvs declaration:

 void __net_exit ip_vs_app_net_cleanup(struct net *net)
 {
-       unregister_ip_vs_app(net, NULL /* all */);
+       struct netns_ipvs *ipvs = net_ipvs(net);
+       unregister_ip_vs_app(ipvs, NULL /* all */);

	here too:

 static void __ip_vs_ftp_exit(struct net *net)
 {
-       unregister_ip_vs_app(net, &ip_vs_ftp);
+       struct netns_ipvs *ipvs = net_ipvs(net);
+       if (!ipvs)

61/84 ipvs: Pass ipvs into .conn_in_get and ip_vs_conn_in_get_proto

	"dreive"

62/84 ipvs: Pass ipvs into conn_out_get

	"dreive"

	Also, scripts/checkpatch.pl --strict /tmp/*.patch gives
me warnings, sometimes for inherited syntax...
