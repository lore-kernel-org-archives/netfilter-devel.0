Sure! I copied this from params.c.  I'll fix it.

I did this according to Patrick's comment:

I found it a bit strange to be able to change the module params in a
per-netns basis, but it is actually possible if you're changing the
parameters via sysfs.  I tried it and it even seems to work. ;)

I can't see any module parameters in the xt_hashlimit.c file.  Am I
looking in the wrong place?

I would be fine with making the module params global (as they were
before), if that's fine with Patrick too.

I'm passing size_t in kp->arg.  It looks quite ugly, because usually
kp->arg is a pointer to some data.  But at least this way, using
offsetof(), I could avoid lots of repeated code for the options...
