I guess the question is whether we really want to send an ICMP
message in this case. The above quote applies to end hosts,
while conntrack is also (probably more commonly) used on routers,
which normally shouldn't attempt reassembly. I can see no real
downside to this though except that it makes it quite easy to
discover firewalls, but that shouldn't be a real problem.
