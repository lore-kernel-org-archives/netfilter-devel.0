I'm not sure all of these counting optimizations will help at the end.
Say we have a small table. A lot of inserts are coming in at the same
time. rhashtable_expand kicks in and all new inserts are going
into future table, while expansion is happening.
Since expand will kick in quickly the old table will not have long
chains per bucket, so few unzips and corresponding
synchronize_rcu and we're done with expand.
Now future table becomes the only table, but it still has a lot
of entries, since insertions were happening and this table has
long per bucket chains, so next expand will have a lot of
synchronize_rcu and will take very long time.
So whether we count while inserting or not and whether
we grow by 2x or grow by 8x we still have an underlying
problem of very large number of synchronize_rcu.
Malicious user that knows this can stall the whole system.
Please tell me I'm missing something.
