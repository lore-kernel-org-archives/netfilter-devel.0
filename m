That's true so far, however I have a trie set implementation queued up
that will make this optional. For nft_hash, sure, it will always be
present, wouldn't make much sense otherwise :)

The offset is currently fixed, however that's not something that is
guaranteed by the implementation but purely by how the code is
arranged. It would be somewhat fragile to rely on this.

Thanks for the review!
