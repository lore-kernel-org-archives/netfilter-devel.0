The documentation is probably not explicit enough, but I would keep the 
behavior as it is now. Setting bridge-nf-call-iptables to 0 makes 
iptables behave as if bridge-netfilter was not enabled at compilation.
Anyway, your patch is almost certainly flawed since the fact that 
skb->nf_bridge can be NULL is used as part of the logic in 
br_netfilter.c: it indicates that bridge-nf-call-iptables was 0 when the 
packet was first processed by bridge-netfilter and should therefore not 
be given to iptables in any other netfilter hook.

cheers,
Bart
