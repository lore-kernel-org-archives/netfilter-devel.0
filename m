Not really.

percpu sockets are going to slow down network namespace creation /
deletion and increase memory foot print.

IPv6 is cleaner because it does not really have to use different
sockets.

Ultimately would would like to have the same for IPv4.

I would rather carry the mark either in an additional parameter,
or in the flow that is already passed as a parameter.
