I don't knot why, that's the way it is done now. From the top of my head
I can't think of any scenario why it would hurt to push the reassebled
packet instead (and of course send out original fragments at the end of
the way for forwarding)

Can you think aof any sane use case this change could possible break?

Look at the patch description. There's an example. The problem is that
fragments are not correctly matched.
