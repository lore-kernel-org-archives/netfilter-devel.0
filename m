Is it possible to have the NFLOG send only one notification to the
userspace? In the example above, once the quota exceeds, the userspace
will be notified of every packet arriving, won't it?  That would cause
unnecessary processing in the userspace.

The userspace could remove the rule when it gets the first notification
and only add it again when it needs to get the information again (as a
"toggle" functionality), but I think that would take too long and there
would be several packets going through before the rule could be removed.
