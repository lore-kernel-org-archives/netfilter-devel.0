Hello.

Sorry for my slow response.

Well, in the first place, I do think conntrack should be
transparent as much as possible.  And, I cannot find other
netfilter conntrack code (ipv4 or ipv6) sending icmp e.g.
parameter problem etc.

As I said before, I agree that netfilter may drop packets
by any reasons, but I do think it should be done silently.
It can increment netfilter's own statistic counting etc.
but it should not increment the core's (especially,
specific) statistic counting.

Reassembling processes are the same.  We should NOT send icmp, and
if ever desired, we might optionally send icmp (in other
module maybe).
