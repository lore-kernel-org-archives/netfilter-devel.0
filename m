I didn't read his email that way.  Perhaps I misinterpreted it.

mm/slab.c has had RCU calls since 2.6.9, so this is not new.

I don't see any point in adding anything resembling SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU_BH,
SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU_SCHED, or SLAB_DESTROY_BY_SRCU unless and until
someone needs it.  And I most especially don't see the point of adding
(say) SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU_BH_SCHED until someone convinces me of the
need for it.  I would prefer to put the energy into further streamlining
the underlying RCU implementation, maybe someday collapsing RCU-BH back
into RCU.  ;-)

We have gotten along fine with only SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU for almost
five years, so I think we are plenty fine with what we have.  So, as
you say, "as the need arises".

I don't see any more need to add me as maintainer of slab and friends
than of btrfs, netfilter, selinux, decnet, afs, wireless, or any of a
number of other subsystems that use RCU.

							Thanx, Paul
