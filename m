Hmm, those were spurious RTOs indeed or a sign of perverted TCP "proxy" 
(or whatever they call them), longest delay spike I've found so far is 
this:

11:27:28.454827 172.16.1.131.56060 > 80.152.31.131.25: . 3989187:3990587(1400)
...
11:28:00.188835 80.152.31.131.25 > 172.16.1.131.56060: . ack 3990587 win 65535

That's 32 seconds? :-D What should TCP do with that :-) ...disregard that 
measurement because some other TCP variant would not be able to use the 
same measurement due to ambiguity problem(?), I don't think so... It seems
that non-FRTO TCP just misses those signs and acts _too_ aggressively ;-),
which is well known to happen when spurious RTO occurs.

...Also, those duplicate ACKs I pointed out earlier are a sign of 
unnecessary retransmissions (they occur both with and without FRTO).
I actually doubt you have any real losses there, I'll probably next 
calculate RTTs based on that assumption in the non-FRTO dump too...
