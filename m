Right.

Those are going to be freed without calls to rcu with my patch. The only
reason for earlier rcu frees are user calls to kfree.

Nope the user must follow RCU guidelines when using objects.

I never said that you do not need an rcu_barrier() for this particular
situation? Why suggest such a thing?

The insertion of rcu stuff in the slab code will lead to future bugs since
now the slab logic is tied to the semantics of a particular rcu
implementatin.

Ok then the user already has to deal with the barriers. The API is
inconsistent if you put this into kmem_cache_destroy.

This is already the second bug on this issue. Given the complexity of rcu
it is to be experted that inserting more RCU semantics into the slab
allocators is likely to cause future chains of new features and
bugs in slab allocators.
