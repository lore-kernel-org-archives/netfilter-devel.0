The idea I had in mind when I asked this question was if we can "move" a 
process inside a container, aka a set of namespaces :)

I suppose when you say "to support all of the namespaces we can support 
with *unshare*", you exclude the pid namespace which is created only 
with clone, right ? Do you think we can extend the concept to all the 
namespaces including the pid_namespace ?

I like the idea :)
