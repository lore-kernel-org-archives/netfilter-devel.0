For what it is worth, I've found your emails to me to be rather "rude"
as well (to borrow the term), and I responded with what I felt was
appropriate.  Perhaps our interactions may have been seen as overly,
or quickly, harsh but I would remind those that we have several years
of history that extends far beyond the lists which obviously affects
how we interact.  Our expectations for each other are clearly higher
than either of us are delivering, so I'm going to suggest what I've
suggested before, albeit privately: let's stick to the code, that's
where we can find common ground.

There were only a few outstanding threads/questions from your last
posting, you should have responses to those sitting in your inbox now.
