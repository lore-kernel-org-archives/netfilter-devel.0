It blocks BH

take a look at commits :

24b36f0193467fa727b85b4c004016a8dae999b9
netfilter: {ip,ip6,arp}_tables: dont block bottom half more than
necessary=20

001389b9581c13fe5fc357a0f89234f85af4215d
netfilter: {ip,ip6,arp}_tables: avoid lockdep false positive

for attempts to let BH fly ...

Unfortunately, lockdep rules :(
