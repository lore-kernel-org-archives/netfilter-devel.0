Actually, if the request to userspace is lost, no retransmission occurs.
there is a timeout to protect this case, and at the end of the tiemout,
a default verdict is apply. So no LSM decision is lost.

for the case of not checking return values, I fixed this in v4 with this
patch :

the main argument for socket_post_accept is to known informations of the
remote inet.

from socket_accept(), we have no clue of who (inet->daddr and
inet->saddr) is connecting to the local service.
with socket_post_accept(), inet->daddr and inet->saddr are filled with
the true distant informations.

This informations is interesting for next security operations on the
socket. (we known with who we are talking to).
