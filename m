I'm tempted to say that we should provide these notifier handlers with
the information they need, explicitly, to handle this case.

Most intdev notifiers actually want to know the individual addresses
that get removed, one by one.  That's handled by the existing
NETDEV_DOWN event and the ifa we pass to that.

But some, like this netfilter masq case, would be satisfied with a
single event that tells them the whole inetdev instance is being torn
down.  Which is the case we care about here.

We currently don't use NETDEV_UNREGISTER for inetdev notifiers, so
maybe we could use that.

And that is consistent with the core netdev notifier that triggers
this call chain in the first place.

Roughly, something like this:

diff --git a/net/ipv4/devinet.c b/net/ipv4/devinet.c
