I just found this patch while cleaning up my tree. I don't know its state
(netdev patchworks says RFC and netfilter patchworks still lists it as
new). However, I also do think that the per interface matching would be
the right thing to do for multicast|linklocal fragments. Perhaps this patch
should be resend?

Yoshifuji, do you think we should also implement RFC 3168 5.3 ECN
fragmentation protection in reassembly.c? I think it should be
straightforward because it is already implemented for ipv4 and the
relevant bits just need to be moved to inet_fragment.c and become a bit
more generalized.

Thanks,

  Hannes
