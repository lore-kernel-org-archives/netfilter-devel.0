OK, some explanation. In tunnel mode, packets go through the stack
again after decapsulation and hit the PRE_ROUTING and LOCAL_IN or FORWARD
hook, depending on if it is a local packet or is forwarded. For symetry,
there are now some additional hooks on the output path which pass the
packet through LOCAL_OUT and POST_ROUTING after tunnel mode transforms.
This part behaves just as any other tunnel. Transport mode is special,
we usually don't want to see packets before or after transport mode
transforms except if it was the plain text packet (the transport
mode SA is the innermost SA of the bundle). On the output path this
already works because packets always hit netfilter before reaching
the transforms, on the input path packets are manually passed through
PRE_ROUTING and INPUT in this case. For NAT we do two things:
when a packet is NATed after already beeing routed (including
the xfrm lookup), it is routed again. If an incoming packet is NATed
before the policy check, the policy check reconstructs how the packet
looked before NAT.

Yes, if the transport mode transform in the innermost transform
of the bundle (or the only one).

Yes.

Yes, even NATing forwarded packets and protecting them using a transport
mode SA works.

They should be fine.
