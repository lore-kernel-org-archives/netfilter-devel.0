Thats a side effect.

Before calling netif_rx() the driver usually calls eth_type_trans()
to pull the ethernet header, so there is the room for 14 bytes.

Normally a driver has NET_SKB_PAD bytes of headroom before the ethernet
header, so the bridge code is safe only if all drivers use this
NET_SKB_PAD padding on receive side. And they really should for
performance reasons.

Better not touch bridge code to catch offending drivers
