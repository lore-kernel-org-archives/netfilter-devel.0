Version 3 of the ipv4/v6 reverse path filter matches discussed
during nfws 2011.

Major change since v2 is that the ipv4 version no longer tries
to determine the (likely) input interface for the reverse test.

To obtain that information, an additional lookup would be
required (first obtain oif, then use that oif as iif in the
reversed lookup -- this is what the existing rpf in fib_validate_source()
does).
While its certainly possible to mimic fib_validate_source more closely,
doing so has certain side effects:
- either pay additonal rt lookup cost
- or, attach the input route early on ourselves, so ipv4 stack does
  not need to do it (which can then cause strange effects when using
  policy routing, as marking in pre-routing has no effect when done
  after -m rpfilter ...)

2nd change is a new "--invert" flag to permit one-line dropping
("-m rpfilter --invert -j DROP") of packets that failed the reverse
path lookup test.

Userspace part is stored in my iptables repository on
http://git.breakpoint.cc/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=fw/iptables.git (branch 'xt_rpfilter_9').

Kernel patches are located in the 'xt_rpfilter_9' branch on
http://git.breakpoint.cc/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=fw/nf-next.git.

Patches will be sent as followup to this email.
