Bailing out if another rule of the same name exists is not an option
right now. Case1 and case2 will look exactly the same to the kernel
module, if you look at the dmesg call for case2 hashlimit_mt_check for
the new rule is called first and then the old rule is deleted so as far
as the kernel module is concerned it appears like someone is adding a
new rule with same name as the existing rule.

Adding --hashlimit-exclusive will solve case 1 but it will error out for
case 2 as well. In case 1 the user is indeed trying to add a rule with
the same name as an existing rule and we can bail out, but in case2 we
are merely restoring it to its original state. But the kernel module
won't be able to differentiate between case1 and case2 because we have
no way of telling whether a user is adding another rule or restoring it.
So if a user tries case2 with --hashlimit-exclusive then
iptables-restore will fail which will be totally unexpected.

One thing we can do to fix this is to make procfs file creation
optional. Right now --hashlimit-name is a mandatory option, I think we
can make this optional so that no proc file is created if the option is
not specified. This will work perfectly with --hashlimit-update and with
both case1 and case2.

I will remove the proc entry rename logic and change the option to
--hashlimit-update. This will work for both the cases provided we make
the procfs file creation optional. If a user specifies --hashlimit-name
then we fall back to the old behavior.

No problem, this turned out to be trickier to solve than I originally
expected. Please let me know what you think about what I proposed above,
I will send a V2 after that.

Thanks,
