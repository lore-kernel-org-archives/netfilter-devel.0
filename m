Sure I'll do that.

Done

OK , I will revert back to register_pernet_subsys(),
and use one single register_pernet_device()  exit hook for :
 - the throttle to disable traffic
 - stop the kernel threads.

I made a quick test of the concept and it seems to work, 
(A mix of new and old connections at 1GB/s into 4 namespaces when killing them all)

Here is a what i did

static inline void
__ip_vs_dev_reset(struct ip_vs_dest *dest, struct net_device *dev)
{
	spin_lock_bh(&dest->dst_lock);
	if (dest->dst_cache && dest->dst_cache->dev == dev)
		ip_vs_dst_reset(dest);
	spin_unlock_bh(&dest->dst_lock);
}

static void ip_vs_svc_reset(struct ip_vs_service *svc, struct net_device *dev)
{
	struct ip_vs_dest *dest;

	list_for_each_entry(dest, &svc->destinations, n_list) {
		__ip_vs_dev_reset(dest, dev);
	}
}

static int ip_vs_dst_event(struct notifier_block *this, unsigned long event,
			    void *ptr)
{
	struct net_device *dev = ptr;
	struct net *net = dev_net(dev);
	struct ip_vs_service *svc;
	struct ip_vs_dest *dest;
	unsigned int idx;

	if (event != NETDEV_UNREGISTER)
		return NOTIFY_DONE;

	EnterFunction(2);
	mutex_lock(&__ip_vs_mutex);
	for (idx = 0; idx<IP_VS_SVC_TAB_SIZE; idx++) {
		write_lock_bh(&__ip_vs_svc_lock);
		list_for_each_entry(svc, &ip_vs_svc_table[idx], s_list) {
			if (net_eq(svc->net, net))
				ip_vs_svc_reset(svc, dev);
		}
		list_for_each_entry(svc, &ip_vs_svc_fwm_table[idx], f_list) {
			if (net_eq(svc->net, net))
				ip_vs_svc_reset(svc, dev);
		}
		write_unlock_bh(&__ip_vs_svc_lock);
	}

	list_for_each_entry(dest, &net_ipvs(net)->dest_trash, n_list) {
		__ip_vs_dev_reset(dest, dev);
	}
	mutex_unlock(&__ip_vs_mutex);
	LeaveFunction(2);
	return NOTIFY_DONE;
}

static struct notifier_block ip_vs_dst_notifier = {
	.notifier_call = ip_vs_dst_event,
};


int __init ip_vs_control_init(void)
...
	at the end
	ret = register_netdevice_notifier(&ip_vs_dst_notifier);
...

and an unregister_ of course.

OK I will try to use unlock methods, if it doesn't work use the mutex.
