OK, thanks for the explanation.

It doesn't, but it provides more flexibility which might make things
easier in case someone decides to add IPv6 support.

Indeed, I noticed this after sending my mail.

Just keep it consistent within your file, though I personally
prefer to keep it inconsistent with some of the other netfilter
files and not use a new line :)

Sticking to the defined semantics avoids the need for special-casing
in generic code like libnl. A new function also doesn't seem like a
loss at all, the only common part between addition and removal appears
to be the iteration.

It very much reminds me of iptables userspace option parsing :|
Please at least use symbolic names for the different cases.
Why does it have to be mapped in the kernel at all? The raw value
of f->wss.wc doesn't seem to be used anywhere else.

Please explain what exactly it does in a comment. Would it make
sense to have the exact values supplied by userspace?
