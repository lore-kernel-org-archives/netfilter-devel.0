Be that as it may, its a maintainer seeing a patch against his
subsystem, reviewing it (albeit early -- we should all want to get
around to reviewing that early) and asking for some clarification.

The fact is, Steve's changelog was very unclear to people not intimately
familiar with the problem space. Asking some clarification just isn't
weird in any way.

Can we please leave it at this, the technical issue seems to be delt
with. You and Ingo seems to have a gift to rub each other the wrong way,
it would be grand if you could both try to be a little forgiving and
just focus on the code/technical issues which makes Linux to what it is,
technically excellent ;-)
