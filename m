ok. I'll prepare a patch for both the printk and the update of
feature-removal-schedule.

libipq is not distributed as a shared library (at least not by us), so I
don't see any purpose for doing so.  Do you think anyone is going to
re-link statically linked code against the new lib

that should be possible, though. =20

I still don't really think that it is worth all the effort, especially
since there is only one hand full of applications using libipq.

The backwards compatibility library is expected to perform a lot worse
thna both the old libipq as well as the new native libnetfilter_queue
due to additional data copies, etc.  When I wrote it, it was more
intended as some intermediate aid, something that helps while people
migrate.  We shouldn't make it too perfect, otherwise they won't migrate
at all.
