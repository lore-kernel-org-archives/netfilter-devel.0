Hi, Cong,

For now, I don't think it's possible to change APIs or  some of their targets
for the panic caused by action xt calling.

The common way should be fixed in net_sched side.

Given that the issue is very easy to triggered,
let's wait for netfilter's replies for another few days,
otherwise I will repost the fix, agree ?
