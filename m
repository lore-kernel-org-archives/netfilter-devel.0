My main concern with this approach is that we may let packets go
through unfiltered for some little time until the worker thread has
the chance to register the hooks.

Alternatives that I see for these are:

* pr_info to indicate the br_netfilter enable by default is
  deprecated. Similar to your small patch 2/2, but it will take quite
  some time until we can finally change this to zero.

* I think we can unregister the hooks when we notice that all
  bridge-nf-call-*tables are zero from the sysctl. We register them if
  any of them becomes 1 again.

Let me know, thanks.
