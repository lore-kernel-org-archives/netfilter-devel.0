Got it, and I did merge -only- the arch-specific definition removals
into one commit.  Should I also merge the core-code definition removals
into that same commit, or is it OK to remove the core-code definitions
with one commit and the arch-specific definitions with another.

(My guess is that you would prefer I removed -all- definitions with one
commit, including the core-kernel definitions, but at this point I figure
I should just ask.)

One Acked-by thus far, so some progress!

Got it.  It allows the developers and maintainers to tell me where my
analysis is wrong, for one thing.  ;-)

Understood!
