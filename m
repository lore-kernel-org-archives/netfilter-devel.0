Hi John,

Cc'ing netfilter-devel (better than only netdev, to attract the
attention from other Netfilter hacker fellows).

Some comments on this:

Unless I'm missing anything worth in this patch, this seems to me like
a combo match of owner + nfacct infrastructure.

I guess you can probably get all done with one single rule, but that
is not enough to justify its inclusion in mainline.

In case you are not familiar with the nfacct infrastructure:

I'd be happy anyway if you provide more examples on you use this, so I
can assure you we can do this with the existing infrastructure in
mainstream.

Thanks!
