Thanks, those flows (there were again some) looks exactly what also the 
working connections in the earlier log do.

...thus there could be other ports that are related as well, do you 
remember what exactly started working in that particular case :-)?

Which of the connections? Mail, nntp, ftp, or the etc.? :-) To the host ip 
which was given for the tcpdump filter, definately nothing was resumed.

I was think that at a time (even thought of enquiring you about this 
part of the config), but the tcpdump log shows a problem that is 
unlikely to depend on timers in any way (and at least some timer expires 
because the SYNACKs are retransmitted, so it's not in some infinite wait 
bug). I'd like to know what causes that and try to solve it.

Once we know the reasons, we can probably easily determinate whether 
there's need to experiment with the timers. Trying to conquer all problems 
at once, when not even knowing how many problems one is going to find is 
not that easy either. Besides, I'd be more concerned about the timers on 
the client after seeing that nothing goes in the network while the nmap 
trick resolves the thing.

The server's log captured not only 995 traffic but everything else to the 
host with the given ip (including udp which should show the tunnelled 
traffic I guess). Unless there's some other route to that host with 
a different ip, I think we don't have much more to find out in the network 
(besides the potential of missing packets from tcpdump during the syn 
flooding, but it's very unlikely that all packets of some active flow 
would be hit at the same time, so something from a progressing flow would 
still be shown even if some of packets would be missing).

This makes me wander if the network behavior is at all related to 
resolving of the problem. Only thing I can think of is that for some 
reason the userspace gets notified much later than it should about
TCP reset and therefore is waiting until that happens and can only
then continue.

...of course if one wants to comment something to keep others posted 
what's happening, one could always note that "so far all good but I keep 
testing for longer time" (that's what some other people say).

It would be too easy explanation, yeah :-). Can you still please check 
next time that there aren't even near that many server processes at the 
server :-).

Adding this wouldn't hurt btw:
