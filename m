Thanks. Once we know what the userspace at the server is doing, it might 
make the problem immediately obvious, though I'm a bit afraid that e.g., 
strace might interfere with the problem so that it resolves right away and 
we're again left with nothing...

I don't really have any I would call "server" in the sense you mean, I 
might occassionally set up one for test from time to time for a very 
limited period but normally it's just ssh and some other which I use so 
rarely that I'd hardly notice, and that's it. I was planning, however,
to setup some day a distcc stress test using all my spare cpu cycles 
(I'd like to put it under kvm but that got stalled due to some timing 
issue at the guest making it to go into an infinite loop), once I get
that working I could probably easily put other test-only stuff to that 
framework as well.

But but, there are other people around the world besides us :-), and 
afaict this is the only (outstanding) report which relates to ceasing of 
accept() so I doubt it's something very regularly occuring thing or we 
would have heard of it.

At least on some machines, but like you have discovered it seems to 
service dependant, so that some processes never got stuck, I might only 
run such or so, who knows...

Ok.
