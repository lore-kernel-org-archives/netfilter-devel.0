This is not so easy - it was decided that we don't want to remove it=20
just that because of connbytes. The final conclusion was to keep it=20
disabled by default (if not enabled by kernel/modules/sysctl option) bu=
t=20
enabling it automatically for the current NS if nefilter rules contains=
=20
"-m connbytes".
