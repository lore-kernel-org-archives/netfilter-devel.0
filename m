I guess we need a cond_resched() in the loop:

diff --git a/net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c b/net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c
index 199fd0f..c07b334 100644
--- a/net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c

                if (err < 0)
                        break;

+               cond_resched();
                set->nelems++;
        }
        return err;
