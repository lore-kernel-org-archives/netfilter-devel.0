I think this is a perfect example of where using MAC 'and' DAC or rather
centrally 'and' user managed profiles would be very fruitful. If you can
create a purely permissive centrally managed per user profile, in fact
delegating a permission set and allow each user to decompose and
discretionary delegate parts of this profile to programs run by this same
user, but with MAC restrictions when delegating to a process run by a
different user, you would IMHO have a very powerful combination of MAC and
DAC.

I'm not sure however a label based MAC system would be best suited for
combining MAC and DAC in such a way.
