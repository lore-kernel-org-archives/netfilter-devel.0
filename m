Here is a cumulative one, which works just brilliant! Thanks a lot, David!
(I cahcnged reported-by tag, since it's Solar Designer who tell us
 about the issue, I forgot to mentioned it in first report, very
 sorry).

Subject: [PATCH] ipv4: Don't do expensive useless work during inetdev destroy.

When an inetdev is destroyed, every address assigned to the interface
is removed.  And in this scenerio we do two pointless things which can
be very expensive if the number of assigned interfaces is large:

1) Address promotion.  We are deleting all addresses, so there is no
   point in doing this.

2) A full nf conntrack table purge for every address.  We only need to
   do this once, as is already caught by the existing
   masq_dev_notifier so masq_inet_event() can skip this.
