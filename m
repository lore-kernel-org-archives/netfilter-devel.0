	Ok. Let's focus on mail:

1) first, my client (Claws-mail -- but it happened with Outlook of
other users too) is working perfectly. I can download new messages. It
connects to port 995 on the server without problems.

2) suddenly it gives me an error message, that it cannot authenticate
anymore (sorry, I don't have the exact message). If I try again to
download new messages, it gives the same error. The connection to port
995 seems stalled or, better yet, cannot complete succesfully. It seems
to time out.

3) the server will stay this way, until I do an "nmap" to the server.
This way, everything goes back to normal.

	So, the server at point 2 got stalled and just an nmap server
can force the server to go back to normal behaviour (I discovered that
nmap solved the issue by luck).

	Ok, that's because I forgot to restrict traffic to port 995 on
the server. Sorry.

	What I can assure you is that other users (which use Microsoft
Outlook Express) had the same problem, so, in this case, we can be
pretty sure it isn't related to user space client.

	Ok, when I get the problem I'll check this.

	Ok.
