Did you observe such problem or is this based on code reading?
I ask because nflog should make sure we always have enough room left in
skb to append a done message, see nfulnl_log_packet():

if (inst->skb &&
    size > skb_tailroom(inst->skb) - sizeof(struct nfgenmsg)) {
	/* flush skb */

Your patch fixes such 'can never send' skb condition by leaking the
skb.  So at the very least you would need to call kfree_skb(), and
perhaps also add WARN_ON() so we catch this and can fix up the size
accounting?
