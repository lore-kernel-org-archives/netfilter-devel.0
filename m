Well, no news ever since. I was backlogged with other stuff, so didn't
push these too much. All I got was two comments to be fixed:

1) indentation should use tabs instead of spaces

2) the IPv6 address detection should be changed to use a function
instead of relying on the first IPv6 address on the interface.

Hopefully I can give this some care in the coming weeks.
