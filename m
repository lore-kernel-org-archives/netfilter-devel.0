Does this patch look fine now or is there something more I need to do to
get it applied?

If it's okay already, are you waiting for the merge window to close
before applying it?

Sorry to bother you with this, but we're depending on this feature and I
need to know if there's something more to be doen.

I'll provide the extension for the iptables tool pretty soon.
