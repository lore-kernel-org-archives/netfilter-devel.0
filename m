The following patches contain an updated version of IPv6 NAT against
Linus' current tree.

The series is organized as follows:

- Patches 01-03 contain bugfixes for SIP helper bugs/regressions
  present in the current kernel

- Patches 04-06 improve conntrack fragmentation handling, the IPv6
  parts are also a precondition for IPv6 NAT

- Patches 07 and 08 prepare the current NAT code for conversion to
  an address family independant core, but contain no functional
  changes

- Patch 09 adds the address family independant NAT core and converts
  the existing IPv4-only NAT code to an AF-specific module

- Patches 10 and 11 add some infrastructure for IPv6 NAT

- Patch 12 adds IPv6 NAT support

- Patches 13-15 add IPv6 specific NAT targets

- Patches 16-19 add some IPv6-capable ports of existing NAT helpers

- Patch 19 is independant of the IPv6 NAT code and adds support for
  stateless IPv6 prefix translation, just to relieve my conscience ;)


Since the last posting numerous bugs have been fixed, I don't remember
all of them, the more important ones include:

- automatic NAT module loading in ctnetlink

- address selection when mapping to IPv6 ranges

- handling of IPv6 fragments

- NAT handling of ICMPv6 error messages

Besides implementing IPv6 NAT, there are no known bugs left. Userspace
patches will follow shortly.

The entire patchset is also available at

Comments, questions and test results welcome.
