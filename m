This actually seems to be the core issue. 
Correct me if i misunderstood what you are trying to achieve: 
Somewhere above, the netfilter code bills some packet. Packet gets 
all the way to the scheduler on egress.
Scheduler drops packet although it has been billed already.
You being a man looking for justice ;-> decides that was unfair and
you are trying to undo it. Is this accurate?

Also is their a corrective factor that happens once the _accounting_ 
data has been shipped? Example: 
- account for packet
- ship accounting data to some billing server
- oops, unbill
- what now?

BTW, what happens if you clone the packet below netfilter and send
several copies of it possibly over several different interfaces? This
may happen with tc extensions.
I think accounting is important - especially if it is almost free with
contracking.
 
Lets talk about this issue first instead of confusing it with everything
else you have in other patches.

cheers,
jamal
