This has nothing to do with netfilter.

This has everything to do with being able to pass a socket down
through the complete ipv4/ipv6 output path.  That's the only
reason netfilter needed to be touched.

The ipv4/ipv6 output call paths have the NF hooks in the middle, and
the NF hooks determine what the call signature is for the rest of the
output path.  That's why it needed to be adjusted.

For ipv6 fragmentation, in particular, having the right ipv4/ipv6
socket is going to be important.

AF_PACKET is not an isolated case, just the most likely example.  It's
just as easy to trigger this problem for other protocol families too.
You can send appletalk packets over VXLAN.

I don't see what is convoluted about using the correct socket for
sending L3 protocol frames.  That's in fact how it's _supposed_ to
work.  And consistently having a proper matching socket available
makes it so that, long-term, we'll never have to deal with this issue
ever again.
