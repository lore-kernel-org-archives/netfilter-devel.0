	The way you prefer. We can fix it after this
patchset.

	For example:

	ciph = (struct ip_vs_iphdr) {
		.len = iph->len + sizeof(_icmph),
		.saddr = iph->saddr,
		.daddr = iph->daddr,
	};
	ciph.protocol = ipv6_find_hdr(skb, &ciph.len, -1, &ciph.fragoffs,
				      &ciph.flags);

	but I'm not sure if the saddr/daddr part compiles.

	ok. But I was referring to this message:

printk(KERN_ERR "IPv6 header not found\n");

	May be it is only in ip_vs_in_icmp_v6, my above
example is for ip_vs_in_icmp_v6, let me know if it
compiles.

	ip_vs_icmp_xmit_v6 expects to see length that
will be made writeable, not exactly offset of header.
May be you can rename the ip_vs_icmp_xmit_v6 argument
from offset to wrtlen, it covers the ports because we
are going to mangle them. Patch 3 should not change
anymore there.

	Very good

	nf_defrag_ipv6 becomes mandatory for IPVS-IPv6.
Conntrack should be optional.

	What happens with fragments if nf_defrag_ipv6 is
not loaded? IPVS will see original fragments without
reasm ptr? I assume IPVS can see them but can not do
much except to mangle addresses and ports.

	May be just like for IPv4, I think, nf_defrag_ipv6
should be loaded (added as dep) but nf_conntrack_ipv6 should
be required only for FTP as we use some code from there.

	We should avoid it if possible. There can be small
routers that do not want conntrack. It would be better if
IPVS uses some symbol that will cause nf_defrag_ipv6 to
load, now we can add it as dep but what if user does not
load it? nf_defrag_ipv6_hooks.c is very small, I'm not
sure if we have to duplicate it just to cause defrag at
prerouting or even input to work for us in the case without
conntrack. Without this support we can not mangle FTP
payload.
