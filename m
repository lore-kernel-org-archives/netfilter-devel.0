Copying settings can easily happen at netowkr namespace creation time.
Copying at any other time is too weird to even think about.  So no you
don't need a parent network namespace pointer to enable copying.

Why not?  The appropriate events should fire globally.  And note
in most use cases participants in a network namespace won't have
permissions to load modules.

You are arguing that creation of a network namespace should use the
kernel's default values for sysctls?  That is a fairly reasonable
position to take.

Why sysfs and not sysctl?

It is not clear to me what is going on, from the limited details I see
in this message it sounds like there may be a bit of overdesign and
tackling problems that do not matter in the real world going on.

For any kernel settings that apply to a network namespace we have
two very basic choices.
- Set them to default values when a namespace is initialized.
- Copy them from somewhere when the namespace is created.

Last I looked at that code we were copying sysctl values from
the initial network namespace instead of the creators network
namespace.  Which has always seemed a bit silly to me.

In general most people don't care and this does not cause an
issue for most folks, or we could not have gone 5+ years without
addressing it.

For most things any practical program at this point is going to
have to set the sysctls it cares about because it is going to
have to run on existing kernels.

Beyond that I don't have a strong opinion but we could either set values
to well expected defaults, or copy them from the creators previous
network namespace.  Both would give deterministic results without any
significant chance of breaking userspace today.

Is their a compelling use case in this conversation that could weigh the
decision of which semantics make the most sense?

Adding sysfs entries or module parameters to change the action of
sysctls sounds like there is something broken somewhere.  Unfortunately
it is not clear to me where that somewhere is.
