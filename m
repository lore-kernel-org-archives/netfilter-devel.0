But they don't need do to a consuming read.
As I said, I can add support for non-consuming reads...

Doesn't NFLOG just pass the packet header to userspace?
How can you derive meta-information like "PHYSIN" and "PHYSOUT" from the 
packet header?

Iff NFLOG is able to produce same log string like LOG does I'm fine.

I understand that I have no chance to fight against the "this can be 
done in userspace"-argument. :-)
