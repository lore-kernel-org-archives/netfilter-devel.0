From: Simon Horman <horms@verge.net.au>

This is intended for use in loops which read data protected by RCU and may
have a large number of iterations.  Such an example is dumping the list of
connections known to IPVS: ip_vs_conn_array() and ip_vs_conn_seq_next().

The benefits are for CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU=y where we save CPU cycles
by moving rcu_read_lock and rcu_read_unlock out of large loops
but still allowing the current task to be preempted after every
loop iteration for the CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU=n case.

The call to cond_resched() is not needed when CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU=y.
Thanks to Paul E. McKenney for explaining this and for the
final version that checks the context with CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP=y
for all possible configurations.

The function can be empty in the CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU case,
rcu_read_lock and rcu_read_unlock are not needed in this case
because the task can be preempted on indication from scheduler.
Thanks to Peter Zijlstra for catching this and for his help
in trying a solution that changes __might_sleep.

Initial cond_resched_rcu_lock() function suggested by Eric Dumazet.
