Good point.  We really should make these risks much more explicit.

However, I still think the risk with bridging is higher, especially
in the presence of virtualisation.  Consider the scenario where you
have to VMs on the one host, each with a dedicated bridge with the
intention that neither should know anything about the other's
traffic.

With conntrack running as part of bridging, the traffic can now
cross over which is a serious security hole.

Cheers,
