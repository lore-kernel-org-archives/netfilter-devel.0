Perhaps, but I have a hard time defining wheter a bridge should
use something like sysctl_ip_fwd_use_pmtu or not.

And doing route lookups will break things for some people, we have zero
guarantee that a bridge has the needed routing information,
its valid to not even configure a default gateway on a bridge.

We could alter defragmentation to provide the size of the largest
fragment seen unconditionally, and use that.

But I honestly think this patch is the best we can do to at least
don't have the IP stack deal with this crap.

Sure, I can investigate doing this.

However, I don't believe that this is fixable given that we might not
have any routing tables; also; we allowed things like transparent PPPOE
and VLAN header stripping.

ip_fragment shouldn't have to deal with increased LL space, as it does now,
and I don't see any way to fix that except adding that extra ll size argument
and having br_netfilter set it.

If you disagree, whats your suggested solution to get rid
of the br_netfilter inline helpers?

Kill support for vlan/pppoe header stripping?
Add route lookup but keep current behaviour as fallback in case we don't
find route?

I wouldn't object to doing that, but I'm reasonably sure it will break
existing setups.

Thanks!
