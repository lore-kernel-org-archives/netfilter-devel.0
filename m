Actually do have a large number of return targets.
In the filter forward chain.

I have actually enabled PREEMPTion, am I in trouble then?

I have modified the .config I got from you, quite a lot, during my 
attempts to find the CCISS/HPSA problem.

Which reminds me that I needed to enable, the follwing config options, 
(which your config didn't have):
  CONFIG_PCIEASPM=y
  CONFIG_X86_X2APIC=y

In order to get rid of a PCI warning:
  NMI: PCI system error (SERR) for reason b1 on CPU 0.
  Dazed and confused, but trying to continue

The system worked fine, and you might not see this issue on your G6 
servers, as its most likely BIOS related (my server is a HP DL370 G6).

FYI: Operations have deployed the kernel on prod server this morning.

Cheers,
