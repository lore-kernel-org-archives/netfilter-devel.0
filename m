I have applied this patchset, but I had to rewrite the patch
descriptions.

I don't blame your English neither your writing abilities (I'm not
native speaker and not that good at writing either) but I think you
can make it better next time.

Basically, you don't need to comment every single change that the
patch does. That's easy to see by looking at the patchset.

Instead, just provide brief explanation on your intentions with the
patch, clarify things that may look not obvious to the reviewer and
what we'll get with this.
