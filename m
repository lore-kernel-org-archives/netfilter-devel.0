actually the patch is ready by now and hci_usb and hci_vhci are tested.
The tests for the other drivers have to wait at least until first week
of August. However since it seems to work even with 2.6.13-rc3, I don't
see any reason to wait with the inclusion. If you are serious with the
shrinking of the sk_buff, I can send you the final patch along with my
pending patches for 2.6.13.

Regards

Marcel
