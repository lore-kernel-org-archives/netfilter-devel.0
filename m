The addresses passed to ->move seems to be bogus, we're doing:

           t->move(ct, ct->ext + ct->ext->offset[i]);

without assigning the new ct->ext first, which is wrong for
two reasons:

- the new ext hasn't been assigned to the conntrack yet,
   so its moving within the same extension

- ct->ext + ct->ext->offset[i] should be (void *)ct->ext + ...

I'll fix it and send a patch after some testing. Still wondering
why this wasn't noticed before.
