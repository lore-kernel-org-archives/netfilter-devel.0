(I know little, so just my 2c)

So... packets are 'tunneled' down a link where MSS is required/added.
However packets which will not fit into the MTU of that 'tunnel' are send
down it without MSS and without fragmentation? I wonder what would happen
if all TCP MTUs worked that way...

Maybe I've misunderstood how path MTU discovery works. But is it and TCP
not built on the premise that the origin source host always receives the
ACKs regardless of reverse route? With PMTU discovery built on that
guarantee, to return the ICMP error to the same source the ACK would go?

If ICMP is administrively crippled to break TCP its not iptables fault,
nor the admin who is using TCP/ICMP correctly to signal available MTU.
