Not only NUMA, but SMP too. counters are integrated in rules themselves=
=2E
So in order to avoid ping pongs between cpus, we choose to allocate
one copy of rules/counters per cpu.

But with some changes, we could let the rules read-only and shared by
all cpus, and shadow counters only on percpu variables, thus reducing
memory costs.
