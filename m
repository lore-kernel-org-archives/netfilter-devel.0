Speaking of git... I noticed people.netfilter.org has a git-daemon,
so that would be fine for iptables, no?

Something related I have been wondering about ...
(actually nf_conntrack_l3proto_ipv4)

skb_header_pointer() is used for the case of a non-linear skb (has to
do with IP fragments?).

In ipv4_pkt_to_tuple in nf_conntrack_l3proto_ipv4.c,
skb_header_pointer() is used to get the [source address of the] IP
header. Since I figured the layer-3 header must always be
unfragmented, would not it be simpler to use ip_hdr(), or is there
something that mandates use of skb_header_pointer?
