We need to avoid having a timer that was deleted by one CPU
getting re-added by another, but want to avoid taking the
conntrack lock for every timer update. The timer-internal
locking is enough for this as long as we have a mod_timer
variant that forwards a timer, but doesn't activate it in
case it isn't active already.
