So fare, I have to agree with you.  I have now tested on the same type
of hardware (although running a 64-bit kernel, and off net-next-2.6),
and the result is, the same as yours, I don't see a any restarts of the
loop.  The test systems differs a bit, as it has two physical CPU and 2M
cache (and annoyingly the system insists on using HPET as clocksource).

Guess, the only explanation would be bad/sub-optimal hash distribution.
With 40 kpps and 700.000 'searches' per second, the hash bucket list
length "only" need to be 17.5 elements on average, where optimum is 3.
With my pktgen DoS test, where I tried to reproduce the DoS attack, only
see a screw of 6 elements on average.

Don't think that is necessary.  My theory was it was possible on slower
single queue NIC, where one CPU is 100% busy in the conntrack search,
and the other CPUs delete the entries (due to early drop and
call_rcu()).  But guess that note the case, and RCU works perfectly ;-)

I also did this test using net-next-2.6, perhaps I should try the
version I use in production...
