You can still use kthread_should_stop inside a wrapper function
that calls kthread_stop and up() the semaphore.

sync_stop:
        kthread_stop(k)
        up(s)

kthread_routine:
        while(1) {
                down(s)
                if (kthread_should_stop(k))
                        break;

                get sync msg
                send sync msg
        }

BTW, each up() does not necessarily mean one wakeup event. up() will
delivery only one wakeup event for one process that has been already
awaken.

I think it's a good idea.

You seem to be defering the overrun problem by using a longer
intermediate queue than the socket buffer. Then, that queue can be
tuned by the user via sysctl. It may happen under heavy stress that
your intermediate queue gets full again, then you'll have to drop
packets at some point.

Not directly related to this, but I'd prefer if any retransmission
support (or any new feature) gets added in follow-up patches. So we
can things separated in logic pieces. Thanks.
