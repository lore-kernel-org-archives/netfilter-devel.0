a forward declaration.

but the exact same argument applies to sk_filter. If that struct is
renamed everywhere else, then the result will only be more confusing.
A forward declaration is the standard workaround to all such cases in
include/uapi/linux/netfilter. See for instance xt_connlimit.h. This is
sufficient to allow userspace build to succeed, without exposing any
kernel structure detail. If you don't even want to leak the name, then
let's make it void *. Keeping a declaration for sk_filter, while
sk_filter is renamed everywhere else is the least good option, in my
opinion.
