Heh, at minimum. :)

Actually, I don't care at all, because I don't do anything with windows
and don't get paid by anyone who wants me to care. ;)

But if we switch to a similar scheme as freebsd we can even care
less because even if some other operating systems or a major provider
decides to disable timestamps on their devices, we would still have
window scaling, sack (and ecn?) under syn dos. So, I do think it is an
improvement and don't see any disadvantages.

So, I don't care as long as the change (and siphash or maybe another
hashing scheme) is secure enough...

Greetings,
