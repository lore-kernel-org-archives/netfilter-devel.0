No need to resend.

Yes, we need this reverse iteration there to handle the 'delete table'
command in the batch. This problem happens since we have
nft_flush_table().

Other callsites are artificially restriction deletion of inactive
objects but that should be removed as we already discuss on the
mailing list.

So I'm applying this, thanks.
