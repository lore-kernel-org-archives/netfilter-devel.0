The 2nd (and last half) of the set folds nf_bridge_info into skbuff,
at the end (where its not initialized at allocation time).

The struct is a lot smaller by then (16 bytes on 64bit, 12 on 32bit)
so we'd increase skbuff size only by 8.

Yes, I had a patch that used a percpu area.  BUT, please see conflicting
patch:

http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/447939/

So if OVS needs such an interface I thought it makes no sense to work
around current API using percpu data.

Andy, it looks like I could either wait for your patches to hit
net-next, or you could refactor your changes based on my ip_fragment
changes; AFAICS the use cases are pretty much the same so both
ovs and bridge netfilter could use one unified ip_fragment().

I agree that change just for br_netfilter sake sucks but please also
keep in mind that right now we have 'extra signalling' into ip_frament
via skb->nf_bridge pointer which I dislike even more.

Sure.  I can then submit the entire series (i.e. part1 without these 3
plus part2).  I have no further br netfilter changes after that.

Sure.

Seems you're right, I'll look at it, thanks Pablo!
