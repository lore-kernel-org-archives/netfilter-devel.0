The intention was to treat ESP & AH in the same way,
but as you say why not use the upper layer

ipv6_find_hdr() will do the trick with a light modification
What about a wrapper like:

int __ipv6_find_hdr(const struct sk_buff *skb, unsigned int *offset,
		  int target, unsigned short *fragoff,  int *fragflg)
{
...
		if (nexthdr == NEXTHDR_FRAGMENT) {
			unsigned short _frag_off;
			__be16 *fp;

			if (fragflg)
			        fragflg = 1;
			fp = skb_header_pointer(skb,
						start+offsetof(struct frag_hdr,
							       frag_off),
						sizeof(_frag_off),
						&_frag_off);

...
}

int ipv6_find_hdr(const struct sk_buff *skb, unsigned int *offset,
		  int target, unsigned short *fragoff) 
{
        return __ipv6_find_hdr(skb, offset, terget, fragoff, NULL);
}
