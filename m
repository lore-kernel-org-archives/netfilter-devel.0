We already do this for nf_conntrack_event_cb and nf_expect_event_cb so
we store 16 byte per netns where one bit would suffice.

Addendum: its also a non-starter as nfqueue data is quite big
and the module won't be loaded in most configurations.

Looking at 70e9942f17a6193e9172a804e6569a8806633d6b again it seems
the problem is somewhat related to this one, although not identical.

Perhaps we should consider adding

nf_netns_feature_ok(struct net *, enum nfnet_feature);

enum nfnet_feature {
	NFNET_QUEUE,
	NFNET_EVENT,
};

and then set/unset that from the netns init/exit handlers.

nf_netns_feature_ok would then just need one bit in struct nf_net
to store wheter whatever feature we care about is available.

We could then de-netnsify those pointers again.

Hmm, AFAIU we can't have packets queued without the netns being on
the list, no?

Well, I don't see how this is fixable without having some means of
detecting wheter 'timing' is wrong...

You could say that making calls that end up in nfnetlink_queue
without a successful ->init() is illegal but in that case you
will need some condition by which the netfilter core can know
wheter that call is ok in the first place.

So I do not think that detecting it within nfnetlink_queue is worse
than detecting this in the caller, in fact, detecting it in callee
is better since the caller can't forget the test...

As I said I did not test it.
I only saw that net_assign_generic() can expand this array so I
figured one has to check if ptr->[id] is useable.

Well, I have no more ideas.

Looking at the number of function pointers used within netfilter
I'm worried that we will end up pushing more and more redundant info
into struct net to solve this "problem".
