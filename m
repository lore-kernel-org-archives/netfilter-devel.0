Hi,

Julian is correct. I made a hack to the code to force it to fail in
ip_vs_protocol_net_init() right after calling register_ip_vs_proto_netns()
for TCP.

With "netfilter: ipvs: Verify that IP_VS protocol has been registered"
applied I think that you could implement the same "test" by jumping to
cleanup after the first call to register_ip_vs_proto_netns() in the for
loop.

In my test all components of IPVS were compiled into the kernel,
no modules.
