well.
let me describe whole picture i want to achieve

1. use htb/sfq on ingress.

i got a traffic, and use few u32 filters to direct it to 3 flows,
priority, interactive, and bulk.
as http normally pass to interactive flow, i want to move long donwload=
s
to the bulk one.

how i trying to find these downloads:

iptables -t mangle -A POSTROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -m connmark --mark =
0
-m connbytes --connbytes 204800: --connbytes-dir both --connbytes-mode
bytes -j CONNMARK --set-mark 0xa
so, http connection where more than 200K downloaded, must got a
connection mark.

since ingress traffic hits qos before netfilter,
i use xt action, to copy connection mark, to a packet.
(action xt -j CONNMARK --restore-mark )
from this moment, i expect packet must have a restored mark

after this, i can use high priority tc filter .. handle 0xa fw flowid 1=
:102
to direct packet with mark 0xa to 1:102 flow (bulk).

now about a problem.

1. i run http download, once i get 200K - i can see that rule in
POSTROUTING is triggered and connection mark is installed (iptables -L
-n -v mangle -- can show number of packets matched by rule)

2. i see to tc stats for my flows, and i see, that packets still going
to interactive flow, not bulk as i expect.

3. from tc -s filter show dev usb0 parent ffff:
filter protocol ip pref 49152 u32
filter protocol ip pref 49152 u32 fh 800: ht divisor 1
filter protocol ip pref 49152 u32 fh 800::800 order 2048 key ht 800 bkt
0 terminal flowid ???  (rule hit 707 success 707)
  match 00000000/00000000 at 0 (success 707 )
	action order 1: tablename: mangle  hook: NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING
	target  CONNMARK restore
	index 5 ref 1 bind 1 installed 394 sec used 11 sec
	Action statistics:
	Sent 783783 bytes 707 pkt (dropped 0, overlimits 0 requeues 0)
	backlog 0b 0p requeues 0

	action order 2: mirred (Egress Redirect to device ifb0) stolen
 	index 5 ref 1 bind 1 installed 394 sec used 11 sec
 	Action statistics:
	Sent 783783 bytes 707 pkt (dropped 0, overlimits 0 requeues 0)
	backlog 0b 0p requeues 0

i can see that packets must reach xt action.

4. lets try to check packets mark with iptables,
if mark restored by xt action - i must be able to match it in preroutin=
g
rule.
iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -m mark --mark 0xa -j NFLOG --nflog-gr=
oup 1

but this rule not macthesd - so, no mark is restored by xt action.

maybe im completely wrong here, and such mode can't work for some reaso=
n ?
