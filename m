I'll test this patch.

After some lengthy debugging, what actually happens here is that the
nf_conntrack_cachep SL*U*B gets corrupted such that the contained
per-cpu cpu_slabs are all pointing to the address of htable_size, which
is then helpfully set to be the value of the individual freelists (the
address of the base of the kmem_cache), or offset '51' into the table.
The worrying thing is it looks like this is actually corrupting other
random memory too, it just happens to bite once we get this far.

Jon.
