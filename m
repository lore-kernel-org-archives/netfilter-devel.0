I had a similar problem while trying to implement virtual routers using 
different
routing tables and something like 'veth' to connect them.

My solution was to add a 'mark' field to the netdevice and allow 
user-space to set
the mark on the device.  This mark was included as part of the 
connection identifier.

The mark is set before the pkt hits the bridge code on ingress, so a pkt 
entering from
eth1 can get a different connection hash from a pkt entering eth2, even 
if all other
data in the packet is the same.

I'll dig it out of my monster patch if something like this is deemed 
useful upstream.

Thanks,
Ben
