Thanks, Jesper. This is my first time to submit a patch, not know much about
the rules.  I will get it soon.

In most cases, we do the atomic operation on ct->status (with set_bit), but
in function nf_nat_setup_info, we
assume that unconfirmed ct is always holded by current cpu, and has no race
against other cpus, so we don't
use set_bit.  
the following code is extracted from the nf_nat_setup_info:
/* Non-atomic: we own this at the moment. */
  if (maniptype == NF_NAT_MANIP_SRC)
	ct->status |= IPS_SRC_NAT;
  else
	ct->status |= IPS_DST_NAT;
