FWIW while I think this is a valid concern, I believe its unfounded.

netfilter_ingress must not force run-time
dependencies like 'oh, you want tc, too bad, no conntrack for you)'.

(and i don't see any need for such a dependency).

I don't see this having anything to do with 'TC hate'.

Lets face it, tc and netfilter are horrid when it comes to play
nice with each other, and functionality provided by both partially
overlaps.

Just look at all the hacks we have in tc to use netfilter (iptables,
conntrack) functionality, or even iptables CLASSIFY target (aka
"tc filters are too hard for me").

In case there is later some really good reason why you need both
tc ingress and nft ingress simultaneously then we can always revisit this
and add a second hook for coexistence, at the expense of more
complexity.

I don't see a use case where you'd need both tc ingress and nft
ingress at the same time.  Can you elaborate?

At the moment I think having two hooks provides no advantage, it only
complicates code.
