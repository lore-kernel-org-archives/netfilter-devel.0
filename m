That's true  offs, fragoffs and flags can be skipped.
Maybe fragoffs still should be set to zero... because it is used in some pl=
aces
I mean for future changes, (it's not needed today)

Like this place in ip_vs_in()=20

if (unlikely(!cp) && !iph.fragoffs) {
=2E.

ip_vs_fill_ip4hdr() is not so heavily used :-)=20
(only in icmp and for fragments in ip_vs_out)

Hmm, I don't think so, then offset needs to be updated before i.e. more code
(ciph is a local var and it's not so expensive to use it.)

A change will be like this,=20

	ip_vs_fill_ip4hdr(cih, &ciph);
	ciph.len +=3D offset;
	/* The embedded headers contain source and dest in reverse order */
	cp =3D pp->conn_in_get(AF_INET, skb, &ciph, 1);
[snip]
	/* do the statistics and put it back */
	ip_vs_in_stats(cp, skb);
+   offset =3D ciph.len;
	if (IPPROTO_TCP =3D=3D cih->protocol || IPPROTO_UDP =3D=3D cih->protocol)
=2D		ciph.len +=3D 2 * sizeof(__u16);
+        offset +=3D 2 * sizeof(__u16);
=2D	verdict =3D ip_vs_icmp_xmit(skb, cp, pp, ciph.len, hooknum, &ciph);
+	verdict =3D ip_vs_icmp_xmit(skb, cp, pp, offset, hooknum, &ciph);

I will remove it, it's good to have your opinion too.=20

No it's to early

Yes that's why I need to copy them to the 2:nd and following frags.

No we don't need conntrack.
This was the tricky and "hidden" part of the patch :-)
I tried to describe it in part 0/2

The magic thing is done in other hooks
skb->mark and skb_dst_copy() is copied from the first fragment
to the re-assembled skb "reasm" (as a temp storage)
which is visible for all the following fragments

	if (!iph.fragoffs && skb_nfct_reasm(skb)) {
		struct sk_buff *reasm =3D skb_nfct_reasm(skb);
		/* Save route & fw mark to comming frags */
		reasm->mark =3D skb->mark;
		skb_dst_copy(reasm, skb);
	}

In ip_vs_preroute_frag6() the dst and fw-mark will be restord
to 2:nd and following frags.

	if (!iphdr.fragoffs)
		return NF_ACCEPT;
	/* Copy stored mark & dst from ip_vs_in / out */
	skb->mark =3D reasm->mark;
	skb_dst_copy(skb, reasm);

Yes, that is how it works.
skb_dst_copy() in PREROUTING  fix the routing into ip_vs since no
ip6tables rules can do that because they only see fragments.

We have been used this patch in our labs for a while now and it seems to wo=
rk.
NAT and tunnel is not that well tested yet since we don't use it.
It's only tested by me. Local RS seems to work I'm not sure that my
tests cover all ICMPv6 cases.=20

Packet to big, time exceeded and ping is what I have tried=20
That in combinations with/without fragments and routing headers in front.
Also a number of invalid frames have been tested.

Have a look at thc-ipv6-1.8 it can produce a lot of strange packets with so=
me help :-)
iperf -Vu can also produce a lot of IPv6 UDP fragments
(traceroute6 and ping6 also do)

I hope it's described above

We are not allowed to do that according to RFC 2460
"Note:=20
   unlike IPv4, fragmentation in IPv6 is performed only by source nodes, no=
t by
   routers along a packet's delivery path"

Yes, I forgot that
