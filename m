When xt_replace_table assigns the new ruleset pointer, it does
not wait for other processors to finish with old ruleset.

Instead it relies oni the counter sequence lock in get_counters()
to do this.

This works but this is very costly if system is busy as each counter
read operation can possibly be restarted indefinitely.

Instead, lets make xt_replace_table wait until all processors are
known to not use the old ruleset anymore.

This allows to read the old rule set counters without the sequence
lock -- as we already know no cpu is using the ruleset anymore
the counters can't change either.
