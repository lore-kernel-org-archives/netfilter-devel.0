What is so strange about it? Is it because it's possible to set the
capability requirement from modprobe arguments? The capability check
already exists in at least in nfnetlink, where it checks for received
messages for the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability.  Is it strange because we're
checking for the capability when someone tries to write to a file?

Yeah, but it's not up to me to decide this.  We have one entire team
dedicated to figuring out how to ensure "security" in our device.  It
was that team who advised us to protect this file by checking for
CAP_NET_ADMIN.
