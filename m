Actually in our case we're filtering outgoing traffic, based on which
local socket that originated from; so you wouldn't need all of that
construct. Also, you wouldn't even need to have an a-prio knowledge of
the application internals regarding their use of particular use of ports
or protocols. I don't think that such a setup will have the same
efficiency, ease of use, and power to distinguish the application the
traffic came from in such a lightweight, protocol independent and easy way.
