Jozsef, a small question about this change.  Should this same check
not exist here:

        case IP_CT_NEW:
                /* Seen it before?  This can happen for loopback, retrans,
                 * or local packets.
                 */
                if (!nf_nat_initialized(ct, maniptype)) {
                        unsigned int ret;

                        ret = nf_nat_rule_find(skb, hooknum, in, out, ct);
                        if (ret != NF_ACCEPT)
                                return ret;
-               } else
+               } else {
                        pr_debug("Already setup manip %s for ct %p\n",
                                 maniptype == NF_NAT_MANIP_SRC ? "SRC" : "DST",
                                 ct);
+                       if (nf_nat_oif_changed(hooknum, ctinfo, nat, out)) {
+                               nf_ct_kill_acct(ct, ctinfo, skb);
+                               return NF_DROP;
+                       }
+               }
                break;

as well?  It's *significantly* less common than the case you fixed,
and perhaps just letting the state time out is acceptable, but I've
seen TCP connections get stuck with the wrong source address if we
haven't hit ESTABLISHED at the point when the routing change occurs
(most reproducible on high latency links).
