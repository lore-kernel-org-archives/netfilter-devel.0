There's no hope in that case :-)  Just take the machine out and give it 
a decent burial.

On the other hand it's not uncommon to see reports that a machine has 
"hung totally" that include output from ping to show that it hasn't.  
Actually it's amazingly common to see this.  And in just this situation 
xt_SYSRQ is still quite likely to work.
