That looks about right but, at least on ARM, I think we have to consider
the semantics of spin_is_locked with respect to the other spin_* functions,
rather than in isolation.

For example, ARM only has a control dependency, but spin_lock has a trailing
smp_mb() and spin_unlock has both leading and trailing smp_mb().
