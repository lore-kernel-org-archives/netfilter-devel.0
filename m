The practical case that worries me is what happens when someone does
"rmmod nfnetlink_queue" while the system is running.  It appears to me
that today we could free the per netns data during the rcu grace period
and cause a similar issue in nfnl_queue_pernet.

That looks like it could affect both the nf_queue path and the
nf_queue_nf_hook_drop path.
