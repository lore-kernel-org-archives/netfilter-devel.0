AFAICS, (one instance of) act_ipt today directly invokes (exactly one
instance of) a target. With act_xt2 as drafted, it instead invokes a
chain, which would

1. leave the construction of the target data and calling it
   to the subsystems they conceptually belong to - the packet filter
2. lets you do matches, jumps and all that.

>Second: Are chain names unique system wide?

Good thing you ask. Chain names are unique within a netns, and this
act_xtables.c draft looks at the packet to get to know its netns, so
that seems fine.

However, your question also leads to looking at whether TC Actions
themselves are sufficiently netns-ified, and it seems this is _not_
the case. Am I right in the observation that variables like
"tcf_ipt_ht" are in fact global rather tha per-netns?
