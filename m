Is the lockdep check a false positive?
Could I run with 24b36f0193 in production, to fix my problem?

I forgot to mention I run kernel 2.6.35.8-comx01+ (based on Greg's stab=
le kernel tree).

$ git describe --contains 24b36f019346
v2.6.36-rc1~571^2~46^2~7
$ git describe --contains 001389b9581c1
v2.6.36-rc3~2^2~42

Any ideas how we can proceed?

Looking closer at the two combined code change, I see that the code pat=
h
has been improved (a bit), as the local BH is only disabled inside the
for_each_possible_cpu(cpu).  Before local_bh was disabled for the hole
function.  Guess I need to reproduce this in my testlab.

Thanks for your 'ninja' input ;-)
