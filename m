The first fragment (offset=0) is given to ip_defrag by conntrack
at PRE_ROUTING, without a dst_entry. Then conntrack is unloaded.
Further fragments are now queued in ip_local_deliver. When the
packet is reassembled and "continues" its way from
ip_local_deliver, it doesn't have a dst_entry.

The opposite way is of course also possible, packets queued in
ip_local_deliver can jump and appear in the PRE_ROUTING hook
when conntrack is loaded, but that way doesn't seem to cause
problems.

Patrick
