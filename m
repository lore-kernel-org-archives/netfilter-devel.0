Yes. I am saying your patch is a brown paper bag.

Real bug is elsewhere, and we must find it, not make it happen less
frequently.

Maybe its a missing barrier, and adding a full RCU grace period is a
waste (of cpu caches space, since call_rcu() fill a potential big list)

>=20

conntrack must have a real problem of refcounting then.

Each time an object A has a reference to object B, we should increase B
refcount, so B cannot disappear.

nat->ct _cannot_ refer ct if we are freeing ct. Thats quite simple rule=

minor or serious ?

I call this a serious problem. netfilter is not a fuzzy logic.

>=20

It depends. This is better than taking the conntrack lock.

SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU is not allowing for fuzzy logic. Rules are we _must=
_
take a reference on object after finding it, and _recheck_ validity of
the object before using it.

Another way to avoid atomic operations in find_appropriate_src() is to
use a seqcount (or seqlock), and change the seqcount every time
something is changed in ct.
