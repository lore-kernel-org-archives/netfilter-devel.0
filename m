xt_policy is a special case because the policy structure is so
large I decided the user should better use the match twice if
he really needs it (its also a quite uncommon use). For the
ifgroup match I think it should behave exactly as the -i and -o
matches: allow matching both in FORWARD, input device in
PREROUTING and INPUT and output device in OUTPUT and POSTROUTING.
