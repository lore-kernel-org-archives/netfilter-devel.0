Hi Rick, nice hardware you have :)

Stephen had a patch to nuke read_lock() from iptables, using RCU and se=
qlocks.
I hit this contention point even with low cost hardware, and quite stan=
dard application.

I pinged him few days ago to try to finish the job with him, but it see=
ms Stephen
is busy at the moment.

Then conntrack (tcp sessions) is awfull, since it uses a single rwlock_=
t tcp_lock
 that must be write_locked() for basically every handled tcp frame...

How long is "not indefinitely" ?=20
