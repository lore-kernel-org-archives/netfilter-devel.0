All those references support my argument that the lock is being
used recursively in this case. It is being acquired multiple
times by the same CPU. This is not new, it has always been
acquired multiple times, so my change does not break anything.

If other implementations of reader locks to not nest the same
way, then on those system iptables can deadlock. Nothing was
changed by this.

If you don't like the proposal please, think of a better alternative.
Not just pseudo code that is broken with handwaving arguments.
