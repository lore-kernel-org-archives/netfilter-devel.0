I am not sure if this is a valid configuration. The setting of sysctl is saying
"don't do iptables on bridge (since I won't be using it)" and then you are later
doing iptables and expecting the settings as if the iptables setup was being
done.

Instead, you should just enable the net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables sysctl.
If a distro chooses to disable it then you may have to do it explicitly.
