I have no problem with this change "per se", but with the
implementation.

As of now, we live without any ugly #ifdef CONFIG_SMP / #endif sections
in the code - and if possible, I would continue this good tradition.

For example the get_counters() function.  Wouldn't all the smp specific
code (for_each_cpu(), ...)  be #defined to nothing anyway?

And if we really need the #ifdef's, I would appreciate if those
sectionas are as small as possible.  in get_counters() the section can
definitely be smaller, rather than basically having the whole function
body separate for smp and non-smp cases.

Also, how much would we loose in runtime performance if we were using a
"rwlock_t *" even in the UP case?.  I mean, it's just one more pointer
dereference of something that is expected to be in cache anyway, isn't
it?  This gets rid of another huge set of #ifdefs that make the code
unreadable and prone to errors being introduced later on.
