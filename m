No, you don't miss anything. I missed that piece of code, you are right
that nf_init_frags is not actually embedded, so that container_of()
doesn't work. I think we probably can save the struct net pointer in
struct netns_frags during inet_frags_init_net(), so that container_of()
can be eliminated.=20

Thanks for testing! I tried to test it too, but seems I can't trigger a
defragment. Any hints?

Thanks!
