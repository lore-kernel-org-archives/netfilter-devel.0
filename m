Hi!

At least to me it was not known (until very recently) that the IPv6
multicast code in net/ipv6/mcast.c bypasses the netfilter hooks - but it
does.

I don't have the time to work on this right now, just wanted to drop a
note to netdev that people are aware of this issue.

This basically means that you cannot do packet filtering with ip6tables
on outgoing MLD packets.

If anyone wants to write a patch before I get the time:  Feel free to do
so.

Dave: I think this would be post 2.6.0 stuff, wouldn't it?
