This is actually not true these days.

When network devices are created user events are generated and the
user can rename the device however they like using a mapping table of
any kind.

And at such point the problem you present doesn't actually exist, you
can know what the device will be named.

And if rule loading dynamically is slow, we should fix that instead of
creating infrastructure and interfaces we don't actually need.
