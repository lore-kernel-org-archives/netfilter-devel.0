[ Pablo, in case you deem this too late for -next just let me know
and I will resend once its open again ]

This adds an optional forward routing cache extension for netfilter
connection tracking.

The memory cost is an additional 32 bytes per conntrack entry
on x86_64.

Unlike any other currently implemented connection tracking
extension the rtcache has no run-time tunables, it is always active.

Also, unlike other conntrack extensions, it can be built as a module,
in this case modprobe/rmmod are used to enable/disable the cache.

Forward test using netperf UDP_STREAM between two network namespaces
(connected via veth devices), tput:

With conntrack + reverse path filtering (rp_filter sysctl=1):
MIGRATED UDP STREAM TEST from 0.0.0.0 (0.0.0.0) port 0 AF_INET to 10.1.12.2 () port 0 AF_INET

  212992           120.00    26279399            112.13

same, but with rtcache (this patch series):
  212992      64   120.00    34508693      0     147.24
  212992           120.00    34507838            147.23

same but with rp_filter=0 and no conntrack modules active:
  212992      64   120.00    42288748      0     180.43
  212992           120.00    42283439            180.41

IOW, this is only useful if conntrack is used anyway.
