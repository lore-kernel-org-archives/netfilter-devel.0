So, a fragmented IPv6 ICMPv6 packet, I assume?

Don't I need to load some of the helper modules, or just the
nf_conntrack_ipv6 module, or perhaps only nf_defrag_ipv6 ?

I was just pointing out *where* the changes occur in your patch. This is
just a "service" to other email readers, so they can spot the changes
faster, I were referring to.
