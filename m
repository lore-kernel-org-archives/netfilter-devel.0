Hi Pablo

I think we don't need to rework this patch set back to v1 by using ipv6=
_find_hdr
for IPv6 part, because IPcomp shared the same characteristic as esp, th=
at's hiding
upper layer protocol.

=46or a packet encapsulated in order of ah->esp->ah->original packet, a=
s you said
par->thoff is set at esp, that's why netfilter esp has a unified implem=
entation
in net/netfilter/xt_esp.c, because it's always the last parse header ne=
tfilter
can reach.

The same rule apply with IPcomp, for example,
(1) ah->ipcomp->original packet
          ^par->thoff
(2) ipcomp->ah->original packet
       ^par->thoff

Both cases (1) and (2) par->thoff can only point into IPcomp header, so=
 in such
circumstance, a unified implementation for both IPv4/6 is feasible, and=
 I have
tested (2) in such implementation, it works anyway.

IMO, a unified implementation suggested by you previous is ok for this =
round review.
