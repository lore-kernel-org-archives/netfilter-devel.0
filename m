I have some simple http traffic generator in case that you want to use
it:

http://1984.lsi.us.es/git/?p=http-client-benchmark/.git;a=summary

You have to use it with willy tarreau's httpterm in the server side.
Iperf is fine, I just wanted to share with you what I use it for
generating traffic.

It allows more interesting evaluation like making experiments with
very short flows and long ones. I think iperf doesn't allow that?
Well, I didn't look at it since long time ago but I remember that it
didn't fit with my needs. Evaluating only throught was not enough for
me. Sessions per seconds are also an interesting value to take into
account in my case.

You have to use connmark so we can skip the hashing in the
established case, otherwise conntrack is a clear loser :-). The point
of this experiment is to see if hashing every single packet is more
performance than hashing only the first one and using the ctmark for
established connections (so we only hash once!).

Eric Leblond wrote a nice documentation on connmark in his blog:

http://home.regit.org/netfilter-en/netfilter-connmark/

BTW, that related in the NEW rule. related is similar to New but for
the first packet of a related connection.

Thanks for taking the time to evaluate this. If you can repeat the
experiments with my comments, we can get interesting conclusions like
demystifying the fact that at conntrack is not that bad in terms of
throughput if you take advantage appropriately of what it provides ;-)
