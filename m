Yes, it does, and it's exactly that. However, as a LSM it can only be
used whilst no other LSM is enabled. 
Samir Bellabes has been involved in the discussion at
linux-security-module too.
Even though I like the implementation personally I'm unsure about
whether this should be dubbed "the one" way to do this or whether there
should be an API for alternative implementations.

The problem here is that all of your three examples do use the LSM
networking hooks too. If two functions are to be called from the LSM
core (ie. the generic LSM one and the networking-LSM one) we get pretty
much the same problem back as if we multiple generic LSMs enabled.

The tuxguardian developers seem to be interested in picking up
development again and as I wrote Samir has already been involved in this
discussion.
