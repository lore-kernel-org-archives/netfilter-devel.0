If we add or change the rule we can not know if iptables' return to
userspace does mean that rule started to act. There may be other queues
already filled with the packets which could match the new rule (like
receiving socket buffer). So effectively we want it to take effect very
soon. What if there will be a timer which will synchronize RCU-added states,
so if we update single rule - it will take effect in a second, and if we
update bunch of them - during the delay second we pretty much can load
them all.
