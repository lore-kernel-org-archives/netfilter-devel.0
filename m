So I finally got a oops with slub debugging enabled. It doesn't really
narrow things down, though, it kind of extends on the possible
suspects. Now adding David Miller and Pablo, because it looks like it
may be netfilter that does something bad and corrupts memory.

Of course, maybe this is another symptom, and not the root cause for
my troubles, but it does look like it might be getting closer to the
cause... In particular, now it very much looks like a use-after-free
in the netfilter code, which *could* explain my original symptom with
later allocation users oopsing randomly.

Without further ado, here's the new oops:

and note the value in %rax: 6b is POISON_FREE, so it very much looks
like it's a pointer loaded from a free'd allocation.

The code disassembles to

   0: 0f b6 ca             movzbl %dl,%ecx
   3: 48 8d 84 c8 00 01 00 lea    0x100(%rax,%rcx,8),%rax

  2b:* 4c 3b 60 40           cmp    0x40(%rax),%r12 <-- trapping instruction

  3c: 48 85 db             test   %rbx,%rbx

and that oopsing instruction seems to be the compare of
"hooks_entry->orig_ops" from hooks_entry in this expression:

        if (hooks_entry && hooks_entry->orig_ops == reg) {

so hooks_entry() is bogus. It was gotten from

        hooks_entry = nf_hook_entry_head(net, reg);

but that's as far as I dug. And yes, I do have
CONFIG_NETFILTER_INGRESS=y in case that matters.

And all this code has changed pretty radically in commit e3b37f11e6e4
("netfilter: replace list_head with single linked list"), and there
was clearly already something wrong with that code, with commit
5119e4381a90 ("netfilter: Fix potential null pointer dereference")
adding the test against NULL. But I suspect that only hid the "oops,
it's actually not NULL, it loaded some uninitialized value" problem.

Over to the networking guys.. Ideas?
