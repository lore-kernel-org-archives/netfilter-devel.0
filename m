I think it deserves a comment in the code, that you are using ack_seq,
to relay this information to the hook, as its not obvious.

And I think we should set it to zero after that, else it will be
visible on the wire, and wireshark complains (with a warning) when it
sees pure SYN packets with a non-zero ACK number (Martin send me a dump
some time ago, and I just checked).

p.s. thanks for working on this module, which we discussed during the
Netfilter Workshop 2013.
