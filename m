For added fun, it works even less in iproute2-3.7.0.

commit e4fc4ada3317ea94452576add25981279d705b14
Author: Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>

    allow pkg-config to be customized
    
    Rather than hard coding `pkg-config`, use ${PKG_CONFIG} so people can
    override it to their specific version (like when cross-compiling).
    
    This is the same way the upstream pkg-config code works.

broke it by causing tc/m_xt.so to no longer link against libxtables.so,
leading to:

# tc [above parameters]
tc: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib64/tc//m_xt.so: undefined symbol:
xtables_init_all


(Makefiles being simpler than $other_buildsys? A distant reality!)
