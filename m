Hi Bart,

Thanks for thinking about this.

I think not.  My reading of the discussion behind the commit is that skb 
cb area could contain something that was confused for IP options.  To 
solve that, and to allow for proper response when the packet's DF flag 
was set, the cb area was cleared and ip_options_compile() was called.  
Calling that function does only part of the job, leaving slots for 
addresses (and possibly timestamps) to be filled in by a later function; 
possibly ip_forward_options().  I did try calling that; it failed; 
skb_rtable() returned NULL.

I have also read enough comments deriding the "incestuous" relationship 
between bridge and IP to convince me that the relationship should be 
severed.  A bridge is such a simple concept which, when it starts 
looking into the payload, ceases to be a bridge.

I have experience in this code measured in hours; not a lot.  I welcome 
correction if I misunderstand things.

They are identical spaces, but you imply a good point: the cb area is 
possibly being used, simultaneously, for two, incompatible purposes.  
Yet another argument for divorcing bridge of ip logic.

Regards,

David
