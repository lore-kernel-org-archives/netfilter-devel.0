Ok, the LSM argument is certainly true, the direct feed I can see, and the ALSAfication of filtering is a highly intriguing solution that does answer the questions I had. From where I'm sitting (and I have no idea whatsoever whether that's remotely close to where anyone else sits), you've made a convincing argument.

You'll get no argument from me on that.

There, I 100% agree. Having worked for a supercomputer startup, I went through the bouncing-rocks-off-heads stage of getting people to see realtime and high-performance were not mutually-exclusive and did indeed have a lot in common.

Again, you'll get no argument from me on that.

You've convinced me.

This is probably the part of the argument that really made the case for me, as it covers both the weird paths problem and the modularity you need to make sure everything does get covered. The "everything gets covered" problem is the toughest part of any kind of access control on sockets and having gone hunting for as many weird and wonderful networking patches, I've seen some truly strange stuff.

Yes, it is a pain, and that makes it an excellent test. Almost anyone can write code that works under the most mainstream of normal conditions, so those simply aren't that useful in telling different methods apart. Things get fun when you start looking around the fringes, because that's when you really get an idea for when something can be readily extended or is going to be hitting a brick wall.

It seems to me that the netfilter proponents have managed to solve everything I've thrown in their direction and have raised some good points regarding LSM. (And apologies if any of my prior posts got on anyone's nerves. I tend to be good at that.) This looks like it's going to be a fascinating and very well-argued debate, which can only be good news for whatever Linux ends up with.
