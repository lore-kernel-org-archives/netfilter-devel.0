This issue has not reproduced for me in quite some time, also I have
updated my hardware a month ago, so I'm likely unable to test any fixes
in this area.

The strange thing however is that for a while I suffered from a
"desynchronization" between "hard locked" and "soft locked" (as
displayed by rfkill) and I had to manually run rfkill to enable WiFi.
After that last kernel panic, things got back to normal. :-) But I
assume that was a hardware issue ...

You can probably close this bug.

Thanks,
