Yes, this is what our userspace apps are doing.  I've formulated my
question in an unclear way.  If you check the rest of the code, I create
sysfs files under the interface's directory and use it as an attribute
to notify the userspace when the timer has expired.

In short, I need to figure out a way to associate each rule with an
interface in sysfs, so I can notify the userspace when the timer has
expired.  I couldn't figure out another way to do it.  Any suggestions?

Okay, if that's the case, then I don't know how to associate the rule
with a specific net object in the kobject tree.  Maybe I have to figure
out a different way to notify the userspace, unless I add the target
option I mentioned above. :/
