OK, but we still have a problem on machines with >=3D 250 cpus,
because calling 250 times spin_lock() is going to overflow preempt_coun=
t,
as each spin_lock() increases preempt_count by one.

PREEMPT_MASK: 0x000000ff

add_preempt_count() should warn us about this overflow if CONFIG_DEBUG_=
PREEMPT is set

#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT
        /*
         * Spinlock count overflowing soon?
         */
        DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON((preempt_count() & PREEMPT_MASK) >=3D
                                PREEMPT_MASK - 10);
#endif


My suggestion (in a previous mail) was to call preempt_disable() after =
each spin_lock(),
and of course doing the reverse on unlock path.
