I posted a followup with that detail later in the thread. In every case
the kernel has CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO set, and in the latter example I posted
I had turned on almost every other debugging option. I currently have a
kernel with netfilter debugging turned on but that's proving harder to
cause to fall over (likely because I changed several other options, so I
will rebuild it to be identical to earlier with just NF debug on).

Jon.
