:) I think its OK since in tunnel mode the decapsulated packets already
need to be allowed by the ruleset, so I think its not too confusing to
expect the same in transport mode.

Please see my mail to Kazunori. The hooks take ownership of the
skb, changing this would become pretty ugly because of queued
or stolen packets. And it would still leave one path where packets
are not directly returned, so I think the double-parsing should
be handled otherwise.

I'm going to try that if I can't come up with something better.
