I wonder if we should bring in the RCU people too, for them to tell you 
that the networking people are beign silly, and should not synchronize 
with the very heavy-handed

	synchronize_net()

but instead of doing synchronization (which is probably why adding a few 
hundred rules then takes several seconds - each synchronizes and that 
takes a timer tick or so), add the rules to be free'd on some rcu-freeing 
list for later freeing.

Or whatever. Paul? synchronize_net() just calls synchronize_rcu(), and 
with that knowledge and a simple

	git show 784544739a25c30637397ace5489eeb6e15d7d49

I bet you can already tell people how to fix their performance issue.
