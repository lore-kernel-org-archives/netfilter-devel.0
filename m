Good catch.  This change should not have been buried in this patch. It
needs to be it's own separate bug fix.

As I read the code we actually do want to pass sk not skb->sk into
ip_local_out.  For all of the reasons that sk is potentially different
from skb->sk already.

The way I understand this is we have pushed an sk parameter through the
output path so that sk_mc_loop(sk) can be called with the tunnel's
socket not whatever is on skb->sk.  This allows for looking to see if
local multicast loopback is configured on the tunnels socket not on the
originating socket of the packet.

I am going to respin my series with that change made into a separate bu=
g
fix, that can potentially be backported.
