That is even more complicated.  What I was thinking was
	do {
		ret = __netif_receive_skb_ingress(skb, pfmemalloc,
						  orig_dev);
	} while (ret == __NET_RX_ANOTHER_ROUND);

Either that or the switch could just be replaced with a if statement 
since the only case that really goes anywhere is __NET_RX_ANOTHER_ROUND 
and everything else just exits anyway.  I had just suggested a do/while 
since that lets the goto be dropped, but an if would allow for avoiding 
any unnecessary indentation on the call to __netif_receive_skb_ingress.
