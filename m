Hi David,

I know that we're in fairly late stage to request pulls, but the IPVS people
pinged me with little patches with oops fixes last week.

One of them was recently introduced (during the 3.4 development cycle) while
cleaning up the IPVS netns support. They are:

* Fix one regression introduced in 3.4 while cleaning up the
  netns support for IPVS, from Julian Anastasov.

* Fix one oops triggered due to resetting the conntrack attached to the skb
  instead of just putting it in the forward hook, from Lin Ming. This problem
  seems to be there since 2.6.37 according to Simon Horman.

You can pull these changes from:

git://1984.lsi.us.es/nf master

Thanks!

  ipvs: fix oops on NAT reply in br_nf context
