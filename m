(small correction ipv6_find_hdr() is not that costly for the general
case of no exthdrs)

This passing the "struct ip_vs_iphdr" actually makes sense.  It reminds
me of the way netfilter/iptables passes the xt_actions_param to each
rule.  Which contains the same information as ip_vs_iphdr.  (note ipvs
register at hooks at a lower level and don't get passed the
xt_actions_param).

Thus, perhaps we should keep these API changes.  Even if we decide to
optimize ipv6_find_hdr().  (as proposed by my RFC patch)

Perhaps we should consider adding a "family" to ip_vs_iphdr, as is done
in xt_actions_param.  This could help us, with collapsing IPv4 and IPv6
code, but i can see that other structs in IPVS carry this info already,
so not sure its relevant.
