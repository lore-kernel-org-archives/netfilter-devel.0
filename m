We could.  Mostly I implemented things in the simplest way possible.

Semantically I know of no reason why need to enter more than one namespace
at once, and I don't expect entering a namespace to be on anyone's fast
path so every last drop of performance was not crucial.

The only justification I can think of for more than one namespace at a
time is that because we have a synchronize_rcu() in the kernel we can
loop in the kernel much more quickly than we can loop in userspace.
