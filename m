That was the goal of v1 patch.. to deal with 'struct sk_filter' only...
Sure. I'll split it into multiple.

I've simplified charging as commit log says. That part always felt
unclean. I'll split charging cleanup as separate patch.
Nothing else comes to mind. Pls suggest.

See the hunk you quoted above. refcnt is already removed.
I see your prep patch for rcu_head removal...
I can rebase on top of it and drop rcu_head out of bpf_prog.

I thought in v1 series you were arguing exactly about introducing them now...
ok, I will drop callbacks and keep refcnt,rcu,filter_size and bpf_prog pointer
in there. Sounds good?

it seems your only objection is 'rcu_head' still being there and rebasing
on top of yours will fix it...
