Pick your favorite distro. Do you seriously believe my tc scripts
will work by default as they used to when the distro ships
with iptables turned on? Get a freshly minted distro
and try to check what the defaults are.
I have no idea what some of these things are for but they
are there.

I consider Pablo a friend, sorry if that came out wrong.

Well, from the tc perspective the angle has been one of laziness
and avoiding to rewrite any features that netfilter has. Essentially
a gateway-to-iptables. It has not been easy.
It does look silly if we copy things netfilter does in our view.

Assuming there is something else using the nft side, now they break
because tc has taken over.
