I have created a blogpost:
  http://netoptimizer.blogspot.com/2010/12/buffer-bloat-calculations.html

Where I explain how it makes sense to have small buffers on links with a 
small bandwidth.

  - ISPs need to adjust the buffer size according to the bandwidth of the 
link.

Adjusting my statement; the asym ACK issue might be part the issue, 
causing the packets to queue in the buffer.

The buffer-bloat issue is very true and a real-life issue.  ISPs need to 
adjust the buffers according to the bandwidth on the link!
