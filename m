One question, how fast is ipv6_dev_get_saddr()? Since the TPROXY target
can execute on a per-packet path (although the socket match should take
care of packets that belong to already-established connections), this
may be performance critical. Is ipv6_dev_get_saddr() something that I
can call so often?
