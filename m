Good to know. Please add this explanation as a comment
in the next iteration.

If GCC had a switch to compile with I16 or I64, I could test,
but it does not. 'long', as used in the netfilter includes,
already bit people in pre-2.6.19, and nowadays we have that compat
crap thing in place.. Just don't take any chance, and go the safe
route with uint32_t.

net/netfilter/Kconfig: (e.g.)

config NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_COMMENT
        tristate  '"comment" match support'
        depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED

The underlying implementation is not of importance here.
It behaves like a bool, and that's all what is needed.

What if optp is odd?

net/ipv4/netfilter/ is about the most dusted place in Netfilter-land.
Take a grep in net/netfilter/ ;-)
