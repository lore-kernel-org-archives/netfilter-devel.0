wow, I have to say I'm impressed. That's the most genius way to
really kill TC.
Patch 1 looks good, patch 2,3,4 are nicely building on top...
until somebody starts asking how patch 5 will look.
In the future netfilter ingress module will be loaded along with
other iptables modules just like conntrack is today and users
who would want to use ingress tc would have to _unload_
netfilter_ingress module, but if it has interesting dependencies
it may mean to unload iptables and the rest.
So at the end the users will have a binary choice either to use
iptables/nft or use tc, because they won't be able to co-exist
because ingress_hook is the only one.
I don't understand this 'tc hate'. Why go out of the way to
make TC more difficult to use ?
Just add _new_ hook for netfilter ingress and both subsystems
can happily co-exist.
