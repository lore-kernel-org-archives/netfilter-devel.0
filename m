    ipvs: fix synchronization on connection close
    
    commit 9d3a0de makes slaves expire as they would do on the master
    with much shorter timeouts. But it introduces another problem:
    When we close a connection, on master server the connection became
    CLOSE_WAIT/TIME_WAIT, it was synced to slaves, but if master is
    finished within it's timeouts (CLOSE), it will not be synced to
    slaves. Then slaves will be kept on CLOSE_WAIT/TIME_WAIT until
    timeout reaches. Thus we should also sync with CLOSE.
