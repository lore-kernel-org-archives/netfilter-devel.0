 I'm going to dare to call FUD on those statements...

  * Load Balancing - what is preventing your routing rules or packet=20
 marking using the same criteria as the NAT changer? nothing. Load=20
 balancing works perfectly fine without NAT.

  * outgoing packet control - packets will happily leave the "wrong"=20
 interface after NAT unless you add routing and firewall controls=20
 separate to NAT. Packet control works *better* without NAT erasing=20
 original IP information resulting in mistakenly NAT'ed packets go out=20
 the wrong interface.


 I have long been of the opinion that all NAT really offers is the=20
 ability to easily and cleanly multi-home several global public prefixe=
s=20
 from a unified PI space. This is a very important aspect for some=20
 networks, even with plentiful IPv6 addresses.

 Claims and use of NAT as a security, load balancing, and routing=20
 control is where most of the nasty side effects and behaviours are=20
 streaming in from.
