It gets more interesting, and this occurs with the code builtin anyway
(I build in to make it easier to kgdb the result conveniently), so I
don't think that's an issue...but...

I hacked up a per-namespace version of hashtables (this needs doing
anyway, since the global stuff is just waiting to break) but then
noticed that the built kernel always ends up linked roughly (the
nf_conntrack_default_htable_size is a direct rename of the existing
htable_size and is now simply the initial size for new hashtables - the=
y
can then have their own sizes independently of this global):

00000000000074c8 l     O .data.read_mostly      0000000000000008
nf_conntrack_cachep
00000000000074d0 g     O .data.read_mostly      0000000000000198
nf_conntrack_untracked
0000000000007668 g     O .data.read_mostly      0000000000000004
nf_conntrack_default_htable_size
000000000000766c g     O .data.read_mostly      0000000000000004
nf_conntrack_default_max

In some of my runs, I've been seeing nf_conntrack_default_htable_size
get corrupted with a value that just happens to be the address of
nf_conntrack_cachep. I looked over the RCU handling and the cache
allocation/de-allocation, but didn't see anything yet. And then I'm not
sure why this address would happen to get written there? It immediately
follows nf_conntrack_untracked so I looked over what happens to that
struct (including the memset, etc.) and didn't see anything either.

Like I said, I dumped the memory with kgdb in a number of runs both
"before" and "after" for the entire page surrounding the corruption and
the only real difference is this change to the value immediately
following nf_conntrack_untracked. There was also a decrement of the
reference count on untracked (I think that's normal? It's like a
catchall for when a connection isn't being tracking anywhere else) so
I'm still looking to weird freeing.

Anyway. It looks like we have a few issues:

1). The conntrack code needs to be looked at for namespaces. I have som=
e
work in progress patches for hashing I can send along later. But that's
just a start really for someone who knows that piece a little better.

2). Some other weird memory corruption of that specific address. Most o=
f
the other people who've had this problem don't have dumps or kgdb.

Jon.
