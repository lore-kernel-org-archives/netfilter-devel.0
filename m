The machine is not getting 300.000 pps, its only getting 40.000 pps (the 
rest is stopped by the NIC by sending Ethernet flowcontrol pause frames)

  http://people.netfilter.org/hawk/DDoS/2010-04-12__001/eth0-rx.png

We are doing 700.000 'searches' per second, with 40.000 pps, thus on 
average the list lenght (in each hash bucket) just need to be 17.5 
elements.  Is this an acceptable has distribution, with 900.000 elements 
in a 300.032 buckets hash table?

This machine only have two CPUs, or rather one physical CPU and one 
hyperthreaded.  The server is a old HP380 G4, with an old Xeon type CPU 
3.4 GHz (1MB cache).  If remember correctly its based on Pentium-4 
technologi, which had a pretty bad hyperthreading.

I was worried about if the "early drop" e.g. free an old conntrack would 
disturbe the conntrack searching?

A small hint when testing, use Haralds tool 'lnstat' to see the stats on 
the command line, thus you don't need to RRDtool graphe every thing:

Command:
  lnstat -f nf_conntrack -i 1 -c 1000

I don't have a multiqueue NIC in this old machine.

I also ran some tests on my 10G testlab, but it didn't go wrong. 
Tweeking the pktgen DDoS I could get the system to do 4.500.000 'searches' 
per sec with a 1.500.000 packets/sec. (Have not reloaded the kernel with 
the new failed lookup stats).  Guess my 10G machines are too fast to hit 
the issues.

Think my machine is some what slower than yours, perhaps its simply not 
fast enough for this kind of workload (pretty sure that the cache is the 
CPU is getting f*ked in this case).

On my machine one CPU in stuck in softirq:

And another observation is that the CPUs are disturbing each other on the 
RX softirq code path.

(/proc/net/softnet_stat column 3)

Monday or Tuesdag I'll do a test setup with some old HP380 G4 machines to 
see if I can reproduce the DDoS attack senario.  And see if I can get 
it into to lookup loop.
