Sorry for the huge delay Herbert, I really appreciate your input,
but I'm stuck in other work.

That would be one possibility. But I'm not a big fan of per-state flags
that affect packet flow, so I think I'd prefer to just ignore this
case. I don't think not handling inner transport mode SAs would be a
big loss, so how about we just skip inner transport mode SAs completely
on output and keep the input code as it is?
