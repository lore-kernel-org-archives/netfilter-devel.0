something like enqueue(dev) that will indirectly call dev->qdisc->enqueue
and handle in that single place that stuff that does not fit well in 
net/core/dev.c

why it should not happen in a good system?
it is an accident that is a sympthom of something. when we
encounter that accident we detect that "sympthom" at the
scheduler. the way the scheduler reacts to that sympthom
is imho part of the policy. i'm somehow advocating that
the policer is something more than the mere filter, but the
filter + that part of the scheduler that decides what to drop...
from that viewpoint there is no big difference between
the filter drop and the "accidental drop" performed
nevertheless in compliance with a given policy.

why not in the other case? :'''(
well, since later on you ask me what i have
in mind, it would be more clear there why i
personally would need it in any case.

if it is the centralization of the stats with the reason code that,
for what concerns the ACCT, says wheter to bill or unbill i
think it is _really_ great :)
still, for what concerns the multiple interface delivery of the
same packet i don't see how it would be solved...

would there be any magic to have some conntrack data per device
without having to execute the actual tracking twice but without locking
the whole conntrack either? what could be the "magic" to let the
conntrack do the hard work just once and handle the additional traffic
policing information separately, in an other data structure that is 
mantained
on a device basis? that could also be the place where to count how much
a given flow is backlogged on a given interface... which could help in
choosing the dropping action... sorry, am i going too much further?

so, after (maybe better to say while :) qdisc is run and dequeues the 
packet.

well, your approach seems to be the most coherent one...

you mean having a fine grained lock just for the stats?

it is not ready, but to say it shortly, i'm trying to serve first who 
has been
_served_ the less.

from the first experiments i have made this behaves pretty well and smootly,
but i've noticed that _not_ unbilling can be pretty unfair towards udp 
flows,
since they always keep sending.

it simply has a priority dequeue that is manained ordered on the 
attained service.
if no drop occours, then accounting before enqueueing simply forecasts 
the service
that will have been attained up to the packet currenlty being enqueued 
when it will
be dequeued.  [ much easier to code than to say... ]
