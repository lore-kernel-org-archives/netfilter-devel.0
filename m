seems no need.

No. there are another entrances: local out and nf_reinject. If there
isn't any packet queued, as netfilter is in atomic context, the nubmer
of unconfirmed cts should be small( at most, 2 * nr_cpu?).

Oh, Thanks, I got it.

No, it isn't really private. But most of time, it is accessed locally,
if it is implemented as a per cpu var.

thanks for your explaining.
