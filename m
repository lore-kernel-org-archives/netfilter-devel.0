A certainly safe bet would be to write, at the top of tc/m_xt.c,

#if XTABLES_VERSION_CODE > 9
#	error Someone call the guy who changed iptables and \
		make him fix it^W^W^W^W say you need help.
#endif

Then I would automatically notify myself of "oh I need fix that too" when I
feed any new releases of {iptables, iproute} through the Open Build Service.

I hope the complete opposite.

The following is a rough, it-compiles, untested never-run, draft of a
module. The vision here is that userspace only ever sends a chain
name to the kernel. The git tree/branch for it is
