I have taken this into iptables, now it is available in the rpfilter
branch.

One inquiry, I need to know copyright / license details for this
extensions/libxt_rpfilter.c

I remember that Harald insisted that having one copyright notice per
.c file is a good practise (even if this doesn't seem to happen in
other iptables extensions files).

No need to resend the patch, I can ammend the patch with the copyright
/ licensing header.

See extensions/libxt_cluster.c for reference.

Applied to my nf-next tree.
