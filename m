Your patches work fine.

I've noticed two small things:
1. Maybe it's a good idea to add a note above the tcp_use_frto() change
to explain that the value is negated. Took me a while to figure out
why there is no "!" in there :-)
2. Maybe rename the "features" option in iproute2 to "disable_features".
Then it would be more intuitive what it does.


btw: If you apply something to the iproute2 git tree,
I got a compiler error while testing the patch:

In file included from lnstat.c:40:
lnstat.h:28: error: field 'last_read' has incomplete type
lnstat.h:29: error: field 'interval' has incomplete type

Attached small patch fixes the issue.

Cheers,
Thomas
