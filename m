Looking closer, it seems that it makes a bit of sense to add a kernel
module to /sys/device/system.  I think it makes more sense than adding
to the module class or to the net class, actually.  The idletimer is not
a net device (so it doesn't fit in /sys/class/net) and it is not a
module, even though it may be handled by the xt_IDLETIMER module.

So we can look at the xt_idletimer as a system device, which is not a
peripheral device in itself, but a software timer device (there are
already similar components).

I'll add the kernel object we need as a system class device, so it will
go under /sys/devices/system/xt_idletimer.  Does that make sense to you?
