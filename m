No, we can't limit the thought to a single-user.
snet [1] is using the uid as one information provided to userspace.
it mean that you can make diffence between this 2 rules :

user 'clara' is 'allowed' to use the program 'firefox' to 'connect' to a
webserver - 'TCP port 80' - on the host - 'IP address'

user 'dirt' is 'denied' to use the program 'firefox' to 'connect' to the
webserver - 'TCP port 80' - on the (same) host - 'IP address'

in the same time, the admin of the box is the only one root. it's not
because the user is logged on X, that he can control network syscalls of
all the OS. (and how will it be possible anyway ?)

and more important, I wrote snet, mainly as a home feature as you are
thinking, but also for administrators, in order to set up a kind of
filtering in LAN for users. Here, nobody will click on accept/deny
buttons, but the decision is put in some databases, controlled by the
sysadmin of the LAN, and in LAN boxes, daemon plug to snet will ask
distant database on verdict for local syscalls.

It make also sens at home in order to avoid this config websites on SOHO
routers to controls NAT/ports redirection :
- start ekiga on a LAN machine, it will do listen()
- snet catch it, allow it and the admin added the feature : ask the SOHO
  routers to do a redirection of incoming call coming from the internet
  to this LAN box.
- stop ekiga, the port is no more in LISTEN state
- delete the redirection on the routeurs.

it's working int the same with DMZ servers.

Again, this is controlled by the admin, and of course, by the only one
user, if he is alone.

I disagree on this, as explained, per-user is just the simple case of
'there is only one user'. this is a specific case, and can't be taken as
generic situation.

And this is not a problem at all, because, I'm already able to managed
uid with snet.

here you are thinking already too far.
let some developpers who wants to play with such a tool, as you, do
what he wants ("remember this decision", caching, ..), independantly of
the kernel+low level tool.
that's why I moved the code to have a library, and a callback function
which will provide all matching requested syscalls.

again, why should we be limited to IPv4 or IPv6 ? we are at the socket
layer, the application layer, so this place is transparent regarding
network protocol or the family, just put the information in the netlink
socket for the userspace too, and let the developper decide what he want
to do (allow AF_INET6 by default entirely)

Please, this has nothing to do with building personnal firewall.
Even if I agree with you, because snet is working by choosing it, at
compilation time, rather than SELinux or smack.., this issue as to be
discuss in the same way it has been done lots of time.

netfilter (specialy libconntrack) will help us for checking in-bound
connection, as LSM seems to be little bit weak on this. people behide
TOMOYO linux have mainly push the problem, but the solution is clearly
not to change the LSM hooks in accept() or receive().

You can match a network packet (IPv4 TCP syn for port 80) to the
previous fact that httpd did a listen() on the port.
So, *your* userspace tool, can have a table, which will keep all
listening port (snet will provide you this information) and in the same
time, you are asking libconntrack to give you packets with NEW state,
and try to match it
IPv4 TCP syn for port 80 ? is there someone allowed (httpd listening on
TCP port 80) to received this ? Yes, great ! let's the packets
bypassing or asking the user if he wants to.

It was the first proposition. Now I understand why it was rejected. [3]
