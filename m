Right, I missed that you're using nhoff + hdrlen in
get_inner6_hdr().

No, what I meant is that for the first fragment, you do
have the upper layer header available. But as we already
discussed for a stable identifier you want to ignore it
anyways.

Yes, but with AH you could either use the ESP SPI or if no ESP
is used the port numbers of the upper layer protocol.

So the probem is that it will return the transport layer protocol
header for fragments with frag_off == 0? We also have ipv6_find_hdr()
which we could modify to indicate this in the frag_off pointer.
