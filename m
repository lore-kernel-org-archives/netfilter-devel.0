CONFIG_JUMP_LABEL says the user wants to use jump labels.
But we also need the toolchain to support it.

That is reflected in CC_HAVE_ASM_GOTO=y, and if both are
set then HAVE_JUMP_LABEL is set to true.

There is basically no real problem here.
This patch only tries to make kernel code that using 
static_key infrastructure appears "unified"

The other parts of kernel either use #ifdef HAVE_JUMP_LABEL,
or use no "#ifdef" at all(the two exceptions are netfilter 
and powerpc modules which I send patches to both).

Jason has suggested me to make the patches:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/8/20/761

"Unified" is the reason, I guess :-)
so rookies like me can have unified examples to follow
