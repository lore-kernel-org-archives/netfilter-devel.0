Got it.  INVALID seems fine to me so far
while further consideration might be needed.

Argh, more explanation.

If you unconditionally send ICMPv6, behavior would be
broken.

If you do really want to send ICMP in netfilter,
you could pretend additional rules in filter table.
For example, ICMP to be sent back only if other exthdrs
do not exist, and other packets to be silently dropped.

This cannot be our clean/final/full answer, so I said it'd
be better to introduce per-exthdr hooks in longer term.
