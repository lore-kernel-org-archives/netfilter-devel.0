To be honest, requiring an additional socket to transmit UDP
encapsulation seems really convoluted to me, especially considering
that this is just trying trying to solve AF_PACKET in nf which seems
like a narrow use case.  Is there no way to test for AF_PACKET sockets
and take action at a lower function?  Does every type encapsulation
need its own UDP socket, or can you just have one which set from the
udp_tunnel when family of skb->sk is AF_PACKET?

Thanks,
Tom
