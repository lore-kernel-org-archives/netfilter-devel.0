Just as a side note, we generally frown upon the
hash-array-of-spinlocks approach to scalability.

If you need proof that in the long term it's suboptimal, note that:

1) this is Solaris's approach to locking scalability :-)

2) every such case in the kernel eventually gets transformed into
   RCU, a tree/trie based scheme, or some combination of the two

So maybe for now it's ok, but keep in mind that eventually
this is certain to change. :)
