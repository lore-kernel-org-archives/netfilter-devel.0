That's bad.  Are you talking about MLDv1 or MLDv2 packets?

Ouch.  We have two issues here:

1) ip6_tables not matching it as icmp6 packet

   This basically means that skb->nh.ipv6h is not initialized, or
   points to skb->raw instead of the ipv6 header.

   I cannot see how this could happen in the mld_sendpack(), since
   itself dereferences skb->nh.ipv6h
  =20
   In the igmp6_send() case, ip6_nd_hdr() initializes skb->nh correct,
   so I also cannot see this happen.

2) ip6_queue copying the linklayer header to userspace

   This means that skb->data does not point at the beginning of the
   ipv6 packet (i.e. skb->data !=3D skb->nh.ip6h), but to the beginning of
   the hardware header (i.e. skb->data =3D=3D skb->head).

   This is because mcast.c writes the full packet including the hardware
   header and _then_ calls NF_HOOK.  All other code (ipv6 or ipv4) is
   building the layer 3 packet, then calling NF_HOOK and later on (via
   ipX_outpur_finish() or dst_output()) adding the hardware header.

of course it is a bug.

So the fundamental question (with regard to the ipv6 gods) is:  Is it
really necessarry that the ipv6 mcast code bypasses the destination
cache?

IPv4 multicast just uses the dst_cache, and thus sends the packet using
the normal dst_output() functions.

I have to admit that I'm not as fluent with the code to decide why ipv6
multicast is the only code in ipv4/ipv6 that manually adds the hardware
header and bypasses the normal dst_otput() way?.  Can somebody explain?

> Let me know if you need further information.

As I am currently travelling, I cannot really play with any multicast
networking (just a single notebook machine here, and it is ppc, so no
user-mode-linux).
