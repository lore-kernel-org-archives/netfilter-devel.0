truesize alert. You should add some documentation that skb_morph()
must not be used in transmit path.

Its not clear to be how this can happen.

skb_morph() being used only from ipv4 defrag (or ipv6 reassembly).

Maybe the problem could be fixed by doing this defrag _before_ setting
skb->sk ?

Also, I would prefer you find a way to put all this logic inside
skb_morph() instead of adding such complexity in this already complex
code, I fear the compiler will generate slower code with your patch on
fast path.

Maybe something as simple as following (untested) patch ?

Note that the truesize concern might need some care.
