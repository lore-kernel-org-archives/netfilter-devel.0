I'm sorry for the lag, I was delayed by other notorious issues ;-)
I'm unable to trigger any crash with the patched kernel.

This one is, AFAICS, safe, because ip_vs_genl_new_daemon() calls
start_sync_thread(), which tries to create a socket of the specified
address family before doing any real action. Such operation will fail
gracefully, and overall we will get an - expected - error to userspace.

If I read the above correct correctly, even that should be safe, for
the same reason: ipv6 socket creation will fail if ipv6 is disabled.

The problem with the patched code is that it tries to resolve ipv6
addresses that are not created/validated by the kernel.
