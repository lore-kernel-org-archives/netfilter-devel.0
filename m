My main problem with your target is that by using it, important and useful 
TCP options are lost: timestamp and SACK. That pushes back TCP by almost 
twenty years.

Here you reason for the target that it protects conntrack itself, but in 
the Kconfig text you write that it protects the servers behind the 
firewall. Both can be true, but if the real goal is to defend the servers 
then your target could simply send a faked ACK to complete the three way 
handshake and that way TCP would not be crippled (conntrack timeout 
should still be adjusted).

Best regards,
Jozsef
