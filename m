Understood. No objection, happy to review patches. I initially did
keep sync/async separate and it lead to considerable code duplication
and complexity. I figured that if a user needs sync insert they could
provide their own locking. I missed to allow controlling the async
resize though. Again, feel free to give a shot, no objections.

This is unrelated to resize run control though, the reason is that
I'm converting tcp_hashinfo et al and they require a hybrid approach.
The tables may be too big to construct a parallel data structure, we
don't want to hold off inserts or deletes while the expensive dump
is underway. Even though we can't build a shadow structure while
locking everybody else out, we still want to provide a way to somehow
achieve consistent information. I think that NLM_F_INTR with fallback
to restarting the dump is a good option and very easy to implement. In
that case, we want to lock out resize from dumping iterations but
still allow parallel insert/delete.
