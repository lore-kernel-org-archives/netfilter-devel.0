The IPv6 mangle table may change the source/destination address and skb->mark
of a packet. Therefore it may be necessary to "reroute" a packet after it
traversed this table. But this should not happen for some special packets like
neighbour solicitations and MLD reports: they have an explicit destination, not
originating from the routing table. Rerouting these packets may cause them to
go out on the wrong interface or not to go out at all depending on the routing
table.

This patch allows to mark a dst_entry as "non-reroutable". icmp6_dst_alloc()
(used by ndisc and MLD implementation) will always mark the allocated dst_entry
as such. A check is added to netfilter (IPv6-only) so packets heading for a
non-reroutable destination are never rerouted.

Remarks:

(1) dst entries allocated by addrconf_dst_alloc() are added to the routing
table like normal routes and skbuffs get assigned such dst entries by normal
rule lookup / route lookup. Therefore it's not needed to mark those dst
entries as non-reroutable: if an skbuff got assigned such a dst entry by
normal routing in the first place, and the changes done by the mangle table
don't affect routing, rerouting the packet will get it there too.

(2) Similar logic exists in IPv4 so local multicast/broadcast messages are
potentially transmitted on the wrong interface. However, it's a less likely
corner case there because those packets are treated differently by local
output routing: multicast/broadcast messages are by default routed to the
interface with a matching source IP-address. But this logic is invalid because
it is allowed to (1) send messages with a source IP-address different from
your own and (2) to assign the same IP-address on multiple interfaces.
So ideally in IPv4 some dsts should be marked as non-reroutable as well.
