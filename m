You (conveniently) skipped this part of his commit message, so
I guess this is the part you didn't read very carefully:

	A later patch will modify __nf_ct_refresh_acct() to use
	mod_timer_noact() which will then save one spin_lock_irqsave()
	/ spin_lock_irqrestore() pair per conntrack timer update. This
	will also get rid of the race we currently have without adding
	more locking in nf_conntrack.

The whole point is to avoid two spin_lock_irqsave() sequences, thus
taking the timer locks twice.

So Ingo, when you say in response:

	Why don't you use?

		if (del_timer())
			add_timer();

you really look foolish and, in fact, disrespectful to Stephen.

This was my objection to your email, it proved that you didn't
really read his changelog message.  He explained perfectly well
what the final goal was of his changes.

And you have this knee-jerk reaction quite often.
