Hmm... so to accept a few more SYN packets per second in SYNFLOOD
attack, we slow a bit normal operations ? (adding one test on each
packet going through conntrack)

If yes (I dont think we should, hackers are stronger than you anyway,
just face it)

v4:
	__read_mostly on nf_conntrack_rnd


What would happen if we let the initialization of nf_conntrack_rnd
only in the insertion case (like currently done) ?=20
Only the first packet received on the machine/conntrack might be hashed
on a wrong slot. Is it a big deal ? If yes, maybe find a way to
recompute the hash in this case, instead of reusing 'wrong' one ?
