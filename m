I would love to see a way to change where IFB hooks [if "hook" is the
right term ], till now i dont think i am able to hook it after nat in
prerouting and before nat in postrouting. Is there a way to do this ?
What i basically do with IMQ is:


                         eth0 [192.168.0.0/24]
ppp0   <---->       eth1 [192.168.1.0/24]
                         eth2 [192.168.2.0/24]

Using imq i can shape upload on ppp0 [postrouting] while still having
the internal private ips from the hosts, and i can shape download in
ppp0 [prerouting] after get the correct nat'ed addresses.

Is there a way to achieve this in IFB ? in a simple way ... :)
