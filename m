Thanks for testing.

First of all I hate doing anything which has an user interface stamp in 
it... :-)

Second, didn't I write about this negation in some of the log messages... 
/me looks for that... hmm... I think I did ...and that's besides the very 
clear help text :-). 

Yeah, it was just that the earlier ip already prints the field as 
"features" though I guess changing also that is a non-problem to existing 
userspace stuff because of the current usage of the field. There's this 
RTAX_FEATURE_ALLFRAG stuff which somebody could be looking for but I 
don't know how likely that will be.

But anyway, point taken. I'll try to change both to disable_features and 
see if that gets accepted.
