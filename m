Right.  I'll change the code so that the two extensions are in the same
file/module.  You're the second person to mention this already. ;)

Yeah, I had already done as you suggested in my previous module
(IDLETIMER), I don't know what I had in my head today when I did it
differently.  Even the name of the macro is totally wrong (_SIZE), it
would make a tiny little bit more sense if it was _LEN.  I'll change it.

Ok, that's a good idea, I'll do that.

Thanks for your comments!
