the conntrack stuff (actually that little part of code that adds unbilling to ACCT in case of a drop) is something that comes later (patch 4) and is not in the pkt sched part. please, don't let it divert your mind from the real point. just forget it for the moment... [in any case it is _not_ in the pkt sched area and as i said in mail 4/4 i don't like to put the variables into dev.c, that's why i am there asking for alternatives]

the api change is there to tell the outside which packet was dropped from the qdisc queue as a consequence of the enqueueing operation. the very first and most important consequence is that instead of having to call the callback function reshape_fail() from the inside of the inner qdisc and having to save information about the last visited class into rx_class and the parent qdisc into __parent you just have to *use one only line* inside a loop in the outer qdisc, isn't it neat?

the main aim of all those changes in the API is not this accounting
stuff but having less and simpler code, which imho is more
straightforward, but this is just my viewpoint.

have a look at how many lines disappeared from sch_cbq.c.... as i said,
in all the other sources all code that has to do with the reshape_fail
can immediatly disappear. just immagine how many lines (and ifdef
blocks!) can disappear from all the inner queueing policies that use
the reshape_fail(). asking the mantainer of an inner qdisc to add some
(furthermore conditionally compiled) code to help the outer qdisc makes
it harder to write and mantain, isn't it?

yes, the patch looks big but there are many changes just because i wanted
to update every single scheduler so that they complies with the slightly
changed API. but now everything is ready to go and much code and overehead
has become unnecessary. i mean, if what i have just written above is not a
rave, then i'd say

"it is better not to overcomplicate the code of any non-root policy just
because one classful qdisc doesnt seem to use the API right"

rather than

"You cant change the enqueue/dequeue API just because one qdisc
doesnt seem to use it right."

and similarly i'd say

"Too many things have now become unnecessary."

rather than

"Too many changes that seem unnecessary"

...isn't this simply amazing?

i'm not making changes to any socket buffer... sorry i can't get the 
point about "If you want to make changes to an skb"

i could interpret your suggestion as to increment the user count when 
passing a skb to the enqueue() of a qdisc so that the kfree_skb() inside 
will just decrement the counter, but still there's the problem of 
always: how can you know from the outside which packet did the 
kfree_skb() apply to?

this is what that conntrack stuff in patch 4 was there for... better to 
say: patch 4 is there to unbill in case of a drop due to traffic 
control. the billing is already done by the patch 3 by Harald Welte, 
that as far as i understood was already on the way for inclusion.
packet action was not there in 2.6.7 when i started coding this patch. 
now i might as well try to dig into it and see if it can help. but, i 
repeat, in any case the main aim of  all those changes in the API is not 
this accounting stuff but having less and simpler code.
