Problem is not _objects_ Christoph, but _slabs_, and your patch is not =
working.

Its true that when User calls kmem_cache_destroy(), all _objects_ were =
previously freed.
This is mandatory, with or withou SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU thing

Problem is that slub has some internal state, including some to-be-free=
d _slabs_,
that User have no control at all on it.

User cannot "know" slabs are freed, inuse, or whatever state in cache o=
r call_rcu queues.

=46ace it, SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU is internal affair (to slub/slab/... all=
ocators)

We absolutely need a rcu_barrier() somewhere, believe it or not. You ca=
n argue that it should
be done *before*, but it gives no speedup, only potential bugs.

Only case User should do its rcu_barrier() itself is if it knows some c=
all_rcu() are pending
and are delaying _objects_ freeing (typical !SLAB_DESTROY_RCU usage in =
RCU algos).

I dont even understand why you care so much about kmem_cache_destroy(SL=
AB_DESTROY_BY_RCU),
given that almost nobody use it. We took almost one month to find out w=
hat the bug was in first
place...
