Hi Pablo,

please consider these IPVS updates for v3.18.

I hope that v2 of this pull request addresses the issues you raised
in v1. In particular "ipvs: use correct address family in scheduler logs"
patch consolidates what was previously 7 patches. And I have provided
a longer description: I hope the tone is closer to what you need.

This pull requests makes the following changes:

* Add simple weighted fail-over scheduler.
  - Unlike other IPVS schedulers this offers fail-over rather than load
    balancing. Connections are directed to the appropriate server based
    solely on highest weight value and server availability.
  - Thanks to Kenny Mathis

* Support IPv6 real servers in IPv4 virtual-services and vice versa
  - This feature is supported in conjunction with the tunnel (IPIP)
    forwarding mechanism. That is, IPv4 may be forwarded in IPv6 and
    vice versa.
  - The motivation for this is to allow more flexibility in the
    choice of IP version offered by both virtual-servers and
    real-servers as they no longer need to match: An IPv4 connection from an
    end-user may be forwarded to a real-server using IPv6 and vice versa.
  - Further work need to be done to support this feature in conjunction
    with connection synchronisation. For now such configurations are
    not allowed.
  - This change includes update to netlink protocol, adding a new
    destination address family attribute. And the necessary changes
    to plumb this information throughout IPVS.
  - Thanks to Alex Gartrell and Julian Anastasov
