It is strange that you check this capability from a module focused on
packet handling. For lack of a better example, it's as if you tried
to check the uid of the file, the latter of which is better left to
the routines in fs/.

You can do whatever you want with your product. I am just saying this
does not look like kernel material, and I suppose it won't go well
with the maintainers up the chain either.
