yes, except for the payload, the missing "send one" packet toggle, and the
verdict we'd have to send back, it's almost identical ;)

What I'm trying to achieve with this target is a simple way to send a
userspace notification to userspace, without having to define a complex set of
rules, matches and having to pass some initial netlink message to set the
target properly (to avoid the payload passing in the NFLOG case).

Thanks for your comments and review.
