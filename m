I understood your point. What I'm saying is that that functional graph
you're describing is too simplistic do be a workable model. Your graph
allows for what you're trying to do, yes. But your graph is not modeling
the reality.

Err... I'm migrating netdevs to assign them to namespaces to allow them
to use them? Setup, basically. Either way a device move only happens as
result of some administrative action; be it creating a new namespace or
changing the physical/logical network setup.

wtf is a "remote" namespace?

Can you please describe your application that requires moving possibly
several network devices together with "their" routes to a different
namespace?
