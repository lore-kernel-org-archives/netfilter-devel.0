Not often. Module-specific limitations that differ from global
definitions are just a pain when they bite. This module also has an
arbitrary low limit on the length of the cBPF program passed, for
instance.

Eric also suggests a private variable to avoid being subject to
changes to PATH_MAX. Then we can indeed also choose an arbitrary lower
length than current PATH_MAX.

FWIW, there is a workaround for users with deeply nested paths: the
path passed does not have to be absolute. It is literally what is
passed on the command line to iptables right now, including relative
addresses.
