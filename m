We're using sync.

No.

I just found 2.6.32.34 kernel differ from upstream kernel,  2.6.32
kernel doesn't have ip_vs_try_bind_dest(), but ip_vs_process_message()
kernel might change conn flags without lock protection. This is fixed in
commit f73181c, following changes:

@@ -834,6 +843,7 @@ static void ip_vs_proc_conn(struct net *net,
struct ip_vs_conn_param *param,
                kfree(param->pe_data);

+               spin_lock(&cp->lock);
                if ((cp->flags ^ flags) & IP_VS_CONN_F_INACTIVE &&
                    !(flags & IP_VS_CONN_F_TEMPLATE) && dest) {
                        if (flags & IP_VS_CONN_F_INACTIVE) {

                if (!dest) {
                        dest = ip_vs_try_bind_dest(cp);
                        if (dest)

So I took this part into 2.6.32 kernel. But I still think the patch I
posted is required for upstream kernel. Even though there are no many
places that rehash conn, this is potential race as cp->flags is not
protected.

Thanks.
