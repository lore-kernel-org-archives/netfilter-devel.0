But a user changing a single rule usually calls (fork()/exec()) a progr=
am=20
called iptables. The underlying cost of all this, plus copying the rule=
s to=20
user space, so that iptables change them and reload them in the kernel =
is far=20
more important than an hypothetical vmalloc_node() performance problem.
