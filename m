I don't see them as similar.

The current options code we are talking about here never references
past legitimate parts of the packet data.  We always check 'length',
and we never access past the boundary it describes.

This was the entire point of my posting.

Talking about padding, rather than the logical correctness of the
code, is therefore a distraction I think :-)
