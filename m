Yes.  My intention is that current->nsproxy->net_ns be changed.
We can already change it in unshare so this is feasible.

Yes.  Inotify would at the very least see that mkdir.  You could also
use poll on /proc/mounts to see the set of mounts change.

No.  More like:

For the outer namespace:
/var/run/netns/<name>

For the inner namespace:
/some/random/fs/path/to/a/chroot/var/run/netns/<name>

For a doubly nested scenario:
/some/random/fs/path/to/a/chroot/some/other/random/fs/path/to/another/chroot/var/run/netns/<name>

Since I would be using mount namespaces instead of chroot it is not
strictly required that the fs paths nest at all.
