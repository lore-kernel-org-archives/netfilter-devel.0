I was not aiming at the general enter case.  There is a very specific case
in networking where we only need a network namespace, not full blown containers
so I was seeing what could be done to handle the easy case.

The big idea is solving the namespace naming issues with bind mounts and file
descriptors.  All of the rest is window dressing for that idea.

setns looks like the easy way but what is really needed for the network namespace
is a way to open sockets that are in a specified network namespace.

Essentially.  I am not hugely interested in solving the general case
if it takes us off into tangents about pid namespace semantics.

I have just realized that while the original use case for having unix
domain sockets able to work across network namespaces was a little
weak, there are much better arguments.  Operationally it is a game
changer.  In the case where you don't need to support migration it
allows direct access to your X server and greatly simplifies the
design of a server designed to start processes in your container.
