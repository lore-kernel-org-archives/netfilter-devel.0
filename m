IMHO, the real problem is not the table duplication. We know that addin=
g
a level of indirection is going to hurt a lot because of cache misses.

Its the atomic op (spinlock) done for every packet, entering every
filter, with the conditional branch we do because of possible recursion=
=2E

per cpu variable, and spinlock... its really expensive.

Stephen tried an RCU conversion some time ago, that aborted because of
RCU drawbacks (too much memory was possibly waiting to be freed after a
grace period). Maybe RCU infrastructure is now ready to try again.

We should do what we did for u64 stats counters in network stack, using
the u64_stats_sync.h infrastructure. No more synchro between the thread=
s
running through rules, and one gathering counters. Better latencies in
particular.
