Several comments below regarding -stable.

OK, I have enqueued these from Julian.

Next time, it would be easier for me if I can fetch these from
patchwork. So either you request a patchwork space for IPVS to Jeremy
Kerr or you Cc netfilter-devel including -stable in the prefix.

These three patches:

* ipvs: fix ipv6 route unreach panic
* ipvs: do not use random local source address for tunnels
* ipvs: fix crash with sync protocol v0 and FTP

apply cleanly via git-am to:

v3.10.x, 3.12.x, 3.14.x, 3.18.x, 4.0.x, 4.1.x

but I didn't compile test, so if you want to have this in -stable, it
would be good to validate that all dependencies are in place.

Regarding this one:

* ipvs: skb_orphan in case of forwarding

This only applies cleanly to 4.1.x here.

Pulled, thanks Simon.
