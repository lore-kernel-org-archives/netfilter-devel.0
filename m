Hi Patrick,

the following patches contain updates to IPVS since 2.6.37-rc1
and are targeted at nf-next-2.6.

- Static and shadow variable clean-ups from Eric

- Preparation for persistence engine syncrhonisation

- Correctness fix for persistence engine match.
  I do not consider this a bug as it can only manifest in a problem
  if there is more than one persistence engine loaded and
  currently only one exists.

- Code cleanps for ip_vs_sync_conn(), ip_vs_process_message()
  and ip_vs_process_message()

- Handle GRO aggregated skbs
  The previous behaviour was to send a needs frag ICMP.
  This is probably stable material.

Please pull from:

I expect more activity before 2.6.37-rc1. In particular Hans is working
heavily with Julian and myself on the new synchronisation code.
