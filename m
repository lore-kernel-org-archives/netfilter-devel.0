The code in question is guarded by (_frag_off != 0), so we are
definitely processing a non-1st fragment currently. The -p match would
happen at the time when the packet is reassembled and thus ipv6_find_hdr
will find the real transport (final) header at this point (I hope I
followed the code correctly here).

The next proto field of the fragmentation header is copied from the
first fragment, thus it may specify AH header but actually only in the
original (unfragmented) packet an AH header is directly following the
fragmentation header, thus the next proto chain is somewhat unstable if
looking at the fragmented packets only.

Bye,
Hannes
