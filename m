You're totally right, I'd missed this (RCU behavior wrt SLAB caches was
one of these black magic voodoo things until Peter Z. set me straight
with his explanation that it only applies to the freeing of the cache
itself, not the objects - that makes sense in the grand scheme of what
RCU is trying to achieve, and so in theory, yeah we could just verify
the ct object we get back out of the cache is from the same ns, should
work just as well as doing per-ns caches, but not as clean IMO). I'm
still not sure it explains the specific corruption I'm seeing, but I
just made some coffee and put on some T. Rex to help me think.

Jon.

P.S. What's up with all the "Welcome, Mr. Bond" and "i_see_dead_people"
and other comments in that code anyway? If you're going to use movie
references, perhaps standardize on one particular genre :)
