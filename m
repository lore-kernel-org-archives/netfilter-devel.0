Not yet. I'll contact the people involved in the discussion about the
serires submitted in 2013 to check what their plans are (and if there
are any).

IMHO this is a more generic issue with containers: there is no (known to
me) link between userspace "containers" and kernel namespaces that could
be used in kernel log messages. In this case, --log-prefix can be used
in netfilter logging rules to identify the container messages belong to.
