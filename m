Maybe *too* generous. :-) I just updated and when I boot I get an early crash in update_netdev_tables which is in netprio_cgroup.c.

I think the above issue will have to be fixed, as it completely prevents booting for any kernel that includes the netprio_cgroup option.

I can start taking a look at this if you like, but I see that Gao feng has two patches in the last set of patches that may be related.

To give you an idea how early the crash is, here are a few log messages leading up to it:
