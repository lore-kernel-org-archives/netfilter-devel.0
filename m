Yes.  That's the way it used to be, and how it would return with the 
change I'm proposing.  The br_parse_ip_option function would be removed 
and its remaining code moved back from whence it came.

The bridge sounds like the wrong place to validate an IPv4 header, 
unless it also validates every type of header; and that can't be right.  
That we need to zero the cb area seems like a big clue that IP's 
treatment of the area is lame.  I think that's where the problem lies, 
and that the right thing to do is to yank out the crap from bridge that 
papers over IP's weakness.
