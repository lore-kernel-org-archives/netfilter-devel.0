Hm not good. Then again, Netfilter does not know where the packet comes
from or where it goes, and Bridge does not know that Conntrack is
(potentially, it even varies) part of PREROUTING.

Bridge unpacks such frames if I've seen the code right :-/

        if (skb->protocol == htons(ETH_P_IPV6) || IS_VLAN_IPV6(skb) ||
            IS_PPPOE_IPV6(skb)) {
                nf_bridge_pull_encap_header_rcsum(skb);
                return br_nf_pre_routing_ipv6(hook, skb, in, out, okfn);
        }

I, too, wonder, why it would unpack PPP here.

However, there is a sysctl flag called vlan_tagged/pppoe_tagged which 
you can se to zero to not pull_encap VLAN/PPP.
