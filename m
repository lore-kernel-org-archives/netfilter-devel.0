Why would we still need the INTR stuff given that Dave has asked
for this to be done outside of rhashtable?

What I'm planning on doing right now is to divide rhashtable users
into two camps, lockless insert/removal vs. locked insert/removal.
netfilter will obviously fall into the latter camp.

For those with locked insert/removal I will make resizing/rehashing
synchronous since there is zero benefit from doing it in a separate
thread.

Once that is done you can then easily walk the table by just holding
the lock, which is what netfilter does today.

I'll probably make netlink locked too since it's much simpler that
way.  Only really high performance users like TCP/UDP sockets need
lockless insert/removal and the complexity that comes with it.

Cheers,
