I missed the last part here  "requires no fragmentation at all"

This can be acomplished by setting --hmark-sp-mask and --hmark-dp-mask to Zero
Then you don't use port in the hash calc.

Yes, after reading once again I see what you mean.
I think that masking src & dst ports will be sufficient, 
i.e. no new param will be needed for hashing strategy.

OK I'll do that.

Got the message :-)
I'll remove it.
