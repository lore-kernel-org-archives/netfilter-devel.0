so, maybe we are saying the same thing but in different words :)

if we blindly look at layer 3 and unbill when a packet is dropped,
then the retransmission is already unbilled :)
it will be billed when it takes place, but the first transmission that
underwent a drop has been unbilled and hence we are square.
this without looking at layer 4.

what i was thinking about was mimicking the conntracking at
a device level, having per each device a singleton object that
has the same buckets as the connection tracking. it could
store a lot of interesting information that would augment queuing
disciplines to better share the pain of drops and also to perform
per-connection head drops instead of connection-unaware
tail-drop.

this would improve fairness and shorten the time tcp sources
need to get the feedback, in a better way than random early
drop does.

having this structure at a device level would be an answer
for the issue of packets cloned to multiple interfaces, as we
would be augmented to perform a separate accounting for
each interface (which seems, afaik, reasonable... in most
cases we would account on a single interface, and we also
should likely get less hash collisions... no more than in the
centralized conntrack).

furthermore, the per-bucket lock you suggested, that should
be a good compromise, would also not "interfere" from one
interface to the other one. well... maybe as soon as enqueues
and dequeues on the same device stay serialized (thanks to
dev->queue_lock) we should not need that further lock
either.

does it make sense?
