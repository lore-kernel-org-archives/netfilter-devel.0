Some background, the semantic of ip_summed is different on the
output than the input path. On input, it means a checksum is
available in skb->csum; and on output it means the packet is
destined for a device that can do hardware checksumming.

I have gotten reports of receive checksum errors on
some systems, it may be related to certain revisions of
hardware. It would be useful to see the message printed out
by the skge driver that shows chip and revision.

Also, on the input path for TCP and UDP, the code does not
depend on the hardware being correct, and if the checksum
is incorrect, it just prints a warning and does a software
checksum before deciding to drop.
Perhaps netfilter code needs to handle that case?
