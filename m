The smallest change seems to be adding the nf_ct_frag6_consume_orig()
call to OVS, plus the morph logic from patch 3. Alternatively if Pablo
is fine with having the series re-targeted, then that sounds
reasonable to me too.

Oh dear. Thanks for the report. I propose wrapping the ip_defrag()
with an skb_get()/skb_consume() as this seems to require the least
invasive changes:

I don't have a test environment to verify this at the moment though.
Let me know if you'll take this with your patch series or if you'd
like me to send it out.

On second thought, this would only affect 'net', and if we're
considering the solution for that tree too then it really doesn't
matter.
