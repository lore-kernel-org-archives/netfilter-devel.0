Yes, the fix is the patch we mentioned yesterday, and you told us you t=
ried it :(

commit 7c0ecc4c4f8fd90988aab8a95297b9c0038b6160

[ICMP]: Dst entry leak in icmp_send host re-lookup code (v2).

Commit 8b7817f3a959ed99d7443afc12f78a7e1fcc2063 ([IPSEC]: Add ICMP host
relookup support) introduced some dst leaks on error paths: the rt
pointer can be forgotten to be put. Fix it bu going to a proper label.

=46ound after net namespace's lo refused to unregister :) Many thanks t=
o
Den for valuable help during debugging.

Herbert pointed out, that xfrm_lookup() will put the rtable in case
of error itself, so the first goto fix is redundant.
