It still is very tempting to implement such things as iptables modules.
For example I consider to create tunnel-like device and iptables target
to implement ip-over-dns tunnel, and I need iptables extension since I
only control single machine outside of my ISP which is not firewalled.
Having new way of writing iptables extensions requires to update
existing machines, which is not possible frequently
(like existing enterprise (r) (c) (tm) solutions...)
