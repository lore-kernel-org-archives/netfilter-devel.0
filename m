I think i am not clearly making my point. There are data dependencies;
If you were to move routes, youd need everything that routes depend on.
IOW, if i was to draw a functional graph, routes would appear on top
of netdevs (I dont care what other functional blocks you put in between
or sideways to them).

You could argue that moving a netdevice where some of its fundamental
properties such as an ifindex change is utter nonsense. But you can
work around it.

Worst case scenario, yes. I am beginning to get a feeling we are trying 
to achieve different goals maybe? Why are you even migrating netdevs?

Triggering on config events is useful and it is likely the only
possibility if you assumed the other namespace is remote. But if could
send a single command to migrate several things in the kernel (in my
case to recover state to a different ns), then that is much simpler and
uses the least resources (memory, cpu, bandwidth). I admit it is very
hard to do in most cases where the underlying dependencies are evolving
and synchronizing via user space is the best approach. The example
of route table i pointed to is simple.
Besides that: dynamic state created in the kernel that doesnt have to be
recreated by the next arriving 100K packets helps to improve recovery.

cheers,
