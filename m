The topology is quite simple, there is a veth pair connected between a
namespace and OVS. The OVS bridge has an internal port. The
bridge is configured with flows to send packets through conntrack
(causing packet reassembly + refragmentation on output), and then
forward packets between the host and the veth. The internal port and
the veth inside the netns have IP addresses configured in the same
subnet.

In the test case, we send a large ICMPv6 ping request from the
namespace to the internal port. The namespace will fragment the IP
message into fragments and send through the veth. OVS processes these,
sends to conntrack (reassembly), then decides to output to the
internal port (refragmenting). The host stack finally receives the
fragments and processes the ICMP request. On response, the host sends
several fragments to OVS. OVS reassembles these and sends them to
conntrack, then decides to forward to the veth. When forwarding to the
veth, the skb frag queue is in this state with many skbs (all except
first and last) having skb->sk populated, and we hit the
BUG_ON(skb->sk) in ip6_fragment() just prior to transmitting to the veth.

In regards to your question about prerouting, does the response even
hit the input path on the host? An ICMP response is generated, and it
needs to be directed out to the device (output path), then when the
internal device receives it, it starts OVS processing.
