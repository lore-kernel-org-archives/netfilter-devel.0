please forget about the 5 bits thingy, I told you. Splitting it up into
bitlevel will screw up the HCI filter completly. However after a look
trough the Bluetooth core it should be quite easy too move the pkt_type
into the control buffer. We already use it for a direction bit. The
nasty thing is that I have to modify all the drivers. So when you
finally decided to shrink the pkt_type, I think that I can come up with
a patch for it quiet quickly.

Regards

Marcel
