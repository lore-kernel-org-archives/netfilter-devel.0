i don't know the code that does that, since afaik it
was not yet there in 2.6.8... if it is, please tell me
because i'm eager to have a full viewpoint of the
forthcoming packet action framework :)

yes, sure...
but for the moment i personally don't know which path
STOLEN and QUEUED packets will follow... it's not
a reproach :) it's just that i simply can't know for the
moment, but i don't want to make you hurry, i perfectly
understand that you've got plenty of things to do :)

in that patch i was not copying them... just passing them by reference 
through a
"struct sk_buff ** const skb" parameter.

what is the difference from before...?

calling:
before) when calling we passed a pointer on the stack.
now) when calling we pass a pointer on the stack

returning:
before) when returning we didn't tell the caller which
packet was dropped
now) when returning we tell the sender which packet
is not queued or is thrown away from our queue to
make place for the packet enqueued.

what happens on the stack now?

for the calling: more or less the same as before :)
for the returning...

1) the external pointer is const, cannot be changed. this
is good to avoid stupid bugs.
2) being the external pointer const, the internal one always
lays in the stack frame of the outmost caller of an enqueue
operation. hust the external one is passed to callees. when
a requeue operation is called, that pointer nevertheless stays
in the stack frame of the outmost caller of an enqueue
operation. that's to say: it never moves from the stack of the
caller of dev->qdisc->enqueue()... [in that case it was dev.c,
but maybe it would be nicer to have it in a sort of
dev->enqueue() that would have to do with device level
conntracking].

additional cost for the function calling? z-e-r-o !!! :)
performance issues? maybe some improvement due
to the elimination of many internal jumps and conditions.

furthermore, telling the caller the packet that we chose to
drop allows it to reshape it without the need for every
qdisc to recur too any callback function.
