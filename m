Hi Jan,

Thanks for your reply.

Thanks, I'll investigate all this a bit more and contact our security
people again.

I dug deeper into the code and I can see that /sys/net has capability
checks (implemented in netdev_store() in net-sysfs.c) and nobody without
CAP_NET_ADMIN will be able to write to the files there.  But in procfs I
couldn't see anything similar and anyone with file write permissions can
modify the files in /proc/net/*.

I see, this is a good example. :) I know that his works (with simple DAC
control), but I think we're looking into a bit more security than that.
I have to discuss this with our platform security people.

Again, thanks for your explanations.
