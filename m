It seems you're assuming that ebpf inherited all the shortcomings
of bpf and making conclusion based on that. Not your fault.
I didn't explain it well enough.
Technically ebpf is a small evolution of bpf, but applicability made a
giant leap. I cannot compile C into bpf, but I can do that with ebpf.
I cannot do table lookups in bpf, but I can do that in ebpf.
I cannot rewrite packet headers in bpf, but I can do that in ebpf, etc.

sorry. It surely looks simple to you, but I cannot figure out what
the above snippet suppose to do. Could you please explain.

what you're seeing is the counter argument to your 'bpf not-simple'
statement :) If bpf snippets were hard to understand, people
wouldn't be including them as-is in their programs.
One can always do 'tcpdump expression -d' to generate bpf snippet
or use libpcap in their programs to dynamically generate them.
libseccomp dynamically generates bpf too.

that example is actually illustrates that nft needs to be continuously
tweaked to add features like 'set'. We can do better.

Here is the example from V2 series that shows how hash tables can be
used in C that translates to ebpf, without changing ebpf itself:
void dropmon(struct kprobe_args *ctx)
{
        void *loc;
        uint64_t *drop_cnt;
        /* skb:kfree_skb is defined as:
         * TRACE_EVENT(kfree_skb,
         *         TP_PROTO(struct sk_buff *skb, void *location),
         * so ctx->arg2 is 'location'
         */
        loc = (void *)ctx->arg2;

        drop_cnt = bpf_table_lookup(ctx, 0, &loc);
        if (drop_cnt) {
                __sync_fetch_and_add(drop_cnt, 1);
        } else {
                uint64_t init = 0;
                bpf_table_update(ctx, 0, &loc, &init);
        }
}
the above C program compiles into ebpf, attaches to kfree_skb() tracepoint
and counts packet drops at different locations.
userspace can read the table and print it in user friendly way while
the tracing filter is running or when it's stopped.
That's an example of fast drop monitor that is safe to insert into live kernel.

Actually I think it's wrong to even compare nft with ebpf.
ebpf doesn't dictate a new user interface. At all.
There is old bpf to write socket filters. It's good enough.
I'm not planning to hack libpcap just to generate ebpf.

User interface is orthogonal to kernel implementation.
We can argue whether C representation of filter is better than json,
but what kernel runs at the lowest level is independent of that.

Insisting that user interface and kernel representation must be
one-to-one is unnecessary restrictive. User interface can and
should evolve independently of what kernel is doing underneath.

In case of socket filters tcpdump/libpcap syntax is the user interface.
old bpf is a kernel-user api. I don't think there is a strong need
to change either. ebpf is not touching them, but helping to execute
tcpdump filters faster.
In case of tracing filters I propose C-like user interface.
Kernel API for translated C programs is a different matter.
ebpf in the kernel is just the engine to execute it.
1st and 2nd may look completely different after community feedback,
but in kernel ebpf engine can stay unmodified.

I'm not sure what you mean here.

nice that your brought this up :)
As I mentioned in v4 thread sk_decode_filter() can be removed.
It was introduced to improve old interpreter performance and now
this part is obsolete.

Well, in my previous email I tried to explain that assembler == ebpf :)
Please post x86_64 assembler code that future nft-jit suppose to
generate and I can post equivalent ebpf code that will be jited
exactly to your x86_64...

I don't think we're on the same page still.
To make this more productive, please say what feature you would
want to see supported and I can show how it is done without
changing ebpf insn set.

No doubt that nftables is a nice framework. Let's keep it going
and let's make it faster.
