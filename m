If you want me to have a look as well, just send me an URL or the patches.

Thanks, Florian just pointed me to these trees. Will have a look at
the changes compared to my tree. I'm actually intending to finish up
the mmaped netlink work once I'm done with IPv6 NAT.

For now I'll just accumulate feedback and will incorporate it into my 
tree. I'll also diff them against your tree and will then send the
final result once all feedback/fixes are included.
