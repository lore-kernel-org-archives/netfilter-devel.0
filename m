I'm presuming that Yoshifuji-san has no objections to applying the
NAT-related hooks twice on IPsec since IPv6 does/will not have NAT.

Given that assumption, we should be able to separate the existing
LOCAL_IN into a read-only (filtering) part and a read-write part.
The latter would be applied unconditionally while the former can
be skipped.

I don't think netif_rx is the problem here.  The question is
how and where do we place the netfilter hooks.  Even without
netif_rx the same problem is going to be there.
