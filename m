Actually worm detection is one of the use cases - I was told about
successful installations several years ago.

It allows to determine that it is Windows version X, there is no way to
distinguish userspace application from each other if they use default
parameters.

OS version detection is somewhat subtle - in earlier days it was
simpler, since each major version broke/changed something especially
in XP stack, in Linux I do not know any similar changes in recent
2.6 kernels.

OSF does increase expressiveness! :)
'--genre Linux' is much more clear than... Do you want me to at least
roughly draw mathing rules enciphered in u32 format?

I agree that matching can be done with u32 (even private OSF TTL games),
but it will much much much more ugly than simple module.

I am also not sure OSF should live in kernel, but what it does it does
good and there is no simple way to do the same with existing
functionality. It is possible, but not simple, and definitely not
trivial for administrator :)

Hmm, I can assure you that simple rule for OSF matching module is much
more clear than zillions above rules, but it can be done indeed. I'm not
sure that 5 years ago all that matches existed, but right now it is
possible. Not trivial and not simple, but probably possible.

To use multple matches one has to chain them into single rule/table,
listing and understaning of which is not simple enough compared to OSF
rules. So it is helper module which allows really simple installation.

Various tricks with TTL used in OSF will complicate that chaining even
more.

IIRC there are at least threee: w1, various accountings and uvesafb.
And I authored only the first :)

There was no nfnetlink either 5 years ago, when OSF was created,
this release is just subsequent update to the project.
At some moment OSF shared netlink group with ulog, but it was
considered harmful, so I dropped support. Netlink usage is
rather trivial: it just sends information about matched packt to
userspace, so it can block it on its own, rise a message in the window
or perform some other steps. Nothing exceptionally complex :)
