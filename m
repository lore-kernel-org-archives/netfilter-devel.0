Alessandro,

This summary applies to all your patches: Too many changes that seem
unnecessary. Take a deep breath.

1) You cant change the enqueue/dequeue API just because one qdisc
doesnt seem to use it right. Whats all that contrack stuff doing in 
dev.c and pkt sched areas?
2) incr/decrementing ref cnt is the right way to go. skbs are shared.
Try running tcpdump with your changes (and what i suspect your qdisc is
doing) to see the effect. If you want to make changes to an skb, get
your own copy (or copy of parts of the skb look at things like clone and
skb_expand and relatives)
3) I have a feeling what you are trying to do is best achieved by
using a tc action and not a qdisc. As an example (based on a
conversation with Harald at OLS) i plan on doing selective contracking
at the ingress/egress - but as a clean separate action and not touching
any other files. If this is what you are trying to do, i can help sit on
the sideline and cheer you own with advice. It is not complicated to do,
time is the issue.
Maybe what you are trying to do is use contracking for accounting?
In which case there will be two independent actions: one to track and
another to account.

cheers,
jamal
