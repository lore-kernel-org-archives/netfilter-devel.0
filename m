Much of the issues raised become redundant due to a much simpler solution proposed by Pablo. Still two issues left, proc and potential existing bug in sk filter case.

This issue may still need to be looked at separately.

-ENOBUFS doesn't provide statistics. It does not detect queue limitation. Also diagnostic needs are many times different than implementation needs. Also many times user uses NETLINK_NO_ENOBUFS in order to avoid penalty for buffer overruns (as for example done in a patch to daq_nfq submitted by you here (http://seclists.org/snort/2011/q2/311) :-) ).

So my arguments are that there in order to fine tune a system it is required to know about the existence and number of packets that went under the radar. As I wrote ENOBUF does not answer all these needs.
I understand it is problematic to change uapi. Tried to minimize incompatibility by keeping the order of arguments. I'll probably use a patch to proc any way. Please let me know if you think there is a point in proposing this patch or is it a "no-no" from kernel's perspective.
