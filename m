...Ok? The hooks mask limits the use of the match to - true to its name -
hooks, so it is implies permitting the use of the match in the
PREROUTING/INPUT/FORWARD chain and chains called from it, as long as
no unlisted chain has a reference to it too. This is how most other
modules, e.g. xt_mac, act too.

Since xt_strict inspects in_dev, and in_dev is not available in
OUTPUT/POSTROUTING, I was suggesting to just limit its use to the
chains where in_dev != NULL.
Or did I misunderstood you?
