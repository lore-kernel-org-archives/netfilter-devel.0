	Some comments:

- About patch 4: ip_vs_icmp_xmit_v6 already calls skb_make_writable
before ip_vs_nat_icmp_v6, that is why we provide 'offset'.

- May be we can provide the offset of ICMPv6 header
from ip_vs_in_icmp_v6 to ip_vs_icmp_xmit_v6 as additional
argument (icmp_offset) and then to ip_vs_nat_icmp_v6. By this
way we can avoid the two ipv6_find_hdr calls if we also provide
the iph argument from ip_vs_icmp_xmit_v6 to ip_vs_nat_icmp_v6,
its ->len points to the ports. ip_vs_in_icmp_v6 provides
also protocol in this ciph, so may be we have everything.

- in ip_vs_in_icmp_v6 there must be 'offs_ciph = ciph.len;'
just before this line:

if (IPPROTO_TCP == ciph.protocol || IPPROTO_UDP == ciph.protocol ||

	The idea is that we linearize for writing the inner
IP header and optionally the 2 ports. That is why old
logic was 'offset += 2 * sizeof(__u16);'

- initially, ip_vs_fill_iph_skb fills iphdr->flags from
current fragment, later ip_vs_out_icmp_v6 uses the same
ipvsh when calling ipv6_find_hdr. Should we initialize
ipvsh->flags to 0 before calling ipv6_find_hdr because
it is I/O argument?

- in patch 5: in ip_vs_nat_icmp_v6 skb_make_writable can
move data to other addresses on linearization. Any pointers
like 'ciph' should be recalculated based on offsets. But
it does not matter because we should not call skb_make_writable
here.

	I also see that we should not send ICMP
errors (FRAG NEEDED/TOO BIG) in response to large
ICMP error packets but it is not related to your changes,
it needs separate change to all transmitters.
