I would like to defer this to the next merge window.

I'd also like to see how the AUDIT code is going to use this, provide
the user in your next submission.

Right now the only user is nfnetlink and it's merely to do a
(sub-)module request.

Therefore it's no surprise that we've never had any real well thought
out semantics defined for the bind method, and it's also why we never
thought of adding an unbind method before.
