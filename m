I think there is going to be a linear slowdown no matter what - 
because sending that many IPIs is going to be linear. (there are no 
'broadcast to all' IPIs anymore - on x86 we only have them if all 
physical APIC IDs are 7 or smaller.)

Also, no matter what scheme we use, the target CPU does have to be 
processed somehow and it does have to signal completion back somehow 
- which generates cachemisses.

I think what probaby matters most is to go simple, and to use 
established kernel primitives - and the above is really typical 
pattern for things like TLB flushes to a process having a presence 
on every physical CPU. Those aspects will be kept reasonably fast 
and balanced on all hardware that matters. (and if not, people will 
notice any TLB flush/shootdown linear slowdowns and will address it)

I could be wrong though ... maybe someone can get some numbers from 
a really large system?
