The notrack dummy conntrack (consider it a flag) is attached in
prerouting raw table. By attaching conntracks at ingress, the notrack
flag will be ignored. Note that this also breaks conntrack templates
via -j CT, that allows us to set custom conntrack timeouts, zones and
helpers at prerouting raw.

Basically, ct templates are attached via -j CT, this template is
munched by nf_conntrack_in, which adds the corresponding ct features
based on the template information.

The conntrack code needs to be generalized to allow creating conntrack
with features all at once (so we can remove the template
infrastructure). Even after that, we'll still have that -j CT rules
will be ignored if you're using, let's name it, act_ct from ingress to
attach the conntrack to it.

With the current approach you're using, people will see conntracks in
the iptables raw table, that breaks the current semantics.

We'll have the netfilter workshop by Q1/Q2 2013 (still TBA), I think
this is material for discussion in it.

cheers,
Pablo
