No, of course not.

I have two similar network cards in that machine (a normal sk98 pci card
and an onboard one that skge calls Yukon lite and the sk98lin driver calls
9521. The onboard one does not, though, work with sk98lin).

What I did test was with skge and the onboard card, and sk98_lin with
the pci card, and in both cases I couldn't get masquerading to work, but
everything else worked fine.

... and I have not tried turning it off with sk98lin (and would like to
avoid it, as it requires reconfiguration to test). If any additional tests
arre required, I will do them, though.

Sorry for the delay :( It's here:

http://data.plan9.de/config.doom

This is the currently-running 2.6.13 config, when testing 2.6.11, i just
did "make oldconfig" on this one.
