Good question. I think we'd need at least three spots since every one
of these subsystems can be used indepedently from each other:

- conntrack/IPVS: PRE_ROUTING/LOCAL_OUT at lowest priority
- ip6tables: first time packet hits ip6t_do_table()?

Actually, looking at ipv6_rcv(), this might not work at all since it
sets skb->transport_header to the first header following the IPv6
header. This is used when processing extension headers by IPv6.
