The pro argument for a build system is not that Linux-only projects
receive unneeded portability work, but that the work involved with
maintaining all the commands in Makefiles, which tend to be a source
of update anomalies, gets reduced.

(I was not trying to make a case for Libtool specifically.)

And yet they do use a build system (which happens to be Automake, but
that's not my point). Was their time spent just to produce,
"unnecessary non-sense", as you call it? I can imagine they will
disagree with you.

They do not.

* running make in subdirs is broken
* iproute2/arpd compilation fails if db_185.h, atm.h is not present
  and
* people could not quite opt out building arpd when they are
  fine with not having it
* the DESTDIR variable was completely abused
* data files were shoven into /usr/lib where they don't even belong
  (that is, if you care about FHS even a tiny bit)
* NO_SHARED_LIBS=y is broken
* -lresolv was added unconditionally when it's not even needed
* CFLAGS was overriden, which means a user running make CFLAGS="-g"
  will kill the all-important -Wall and -I../include
* Out-of-tree building, anyone?

But what do I say; if it works _for you_, I must be wrong by
definition.
