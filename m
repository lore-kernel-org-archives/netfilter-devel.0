Can iptables do a network to network nat without having to write out a bunch of 
nat rules.
In other words translate  192.168.198.0/24 to 172.16.10.0/24 without having to 
write out
256 rules.

Also can iptables handle 1000 nat rules like above if they have to be written out on
a 1.66ghz intel dual core atom with 1gb of mem.

I know this isn't appropriate question for devel list but I didn't find anything 
googling.

Thanks,
