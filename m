While we're discussing the patch, another question, about revisions: I
tested both modified and original iptables binaries on both standard
and modified kernels. It all works as expected, except for the case
where both binaries are used on a single kernel. For instance:

  iptables -A OUTPUT -m bpf --bytecode "`./nfbpf_compile RAW 'udp port
8000'`" -j LOG
  ./iptables.new -L

Here the new binary will interpret the object as xt_bpf_match_v1, but
iptables has inserted xt_bpf_match. The same problem happens the other
way around. A new binary can be made robust to detect old structs, but
not the other way around. Specific to bpf, the existing xt_bpf code
has an unfortunate bug that it always prints at least one line of
code, even if ->bpf_program_num_elems == 0.

I notice that other extensions also do not necessarily only extend
struct vN in vN+1. Is the above a known issue?
