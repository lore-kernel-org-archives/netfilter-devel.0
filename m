Done.

I see. The problem is that it will take some time until that manpage
update reaches main distributions, by that time we may have fixed it
already in existing kernels. Then, we'll have to remove it again. I
still think patch 1 already provides some clue to programmers
regarding EPERM at this moment (even if not so explicit and detailed).

Please, ping me again if we didn't come up with some solution for this
in some prudential amount of time.

Regards.
