I'm going to take this patch including the comment style fix, I would
like to avoid specific patches to fix coding style issues, and the
first line of this comment is updated. I think the patch will be still

I'll send a follow a patch to change the return verdict to NF_DROP to
not mix up different things.

Thanks!
