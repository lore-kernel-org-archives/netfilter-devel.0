This is another batch towards the planned skb->nf_bridge removal.

These patches rid ip_fragment of the bridge netfilter mtu/ll hacks
and remove the nf_bridge_info->data area that is used to store
original mac address for refragmentation and neigh resolution.

The need to use it for the DNAT detection is already resolved
via

http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/448342/

These patches go on top of this.

While at it, this series also replaces the 'mask' flags with
a tristate enum to separate those 'flags' that have to be visible
outside of bridge netfilter context and those that are internal.

Tested, on host connected to kvm-bridge:

ping -s $bignum $ip_behind_bridge

on bridge:
-j REDIRECT
-j DNAT --to-destination $ip_behind_bridge
