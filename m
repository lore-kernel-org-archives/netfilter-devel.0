A word of caution here, and something I expect needs to be thought
about.  The reason sk is passed through netfilter and some of the other
paths is that there are tunnel cases where there are two sk's in play
and the passed in socket makes it possible to have both sk's available.

I really don't understand all of the details, but they exist in the git
history of the change.

Reading your change description it does not feel as though you are aware
of the subtleties and as such I suspect your code gets something wrong.


The placing of sk as the first word in struct nft_pktinfo is also a
little concerning, as I don't expect it will be as highly used as
the later fields, and everything that is highly used we want to keep
in one cache line if we can.
