Not sure this has less overhead.

Yes, by configuring the client to use the proxy.

Depends on your environment and the proxy.

First requirement is that the proxy is running inline on a gateway in the
data path between the webserver and the client. If this is not the case 
then forget about it.

If it is a normal Internet proxy environment where the number of clients 
are limited, and the proxy supports per-user selection of the outgoing 
address (Squid does) then it is possible with the help of NAT.

1. Set up as many IP aliases on the proxy server as you have clients. Use
one of the unassigned networks.

2. Configure the proxy to use one IP alias per client IP address.

3. Configure iptables NAT rules in OUTPUT to NAT these IP aliases back to
the client IP address.


If it is a reverse proxy or other environment where the client addresses 
are not limited then this obviously can not be done and you must use the 
tproxy patch.
