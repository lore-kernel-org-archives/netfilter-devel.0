xtables list and save interfaces share xt_match and xt_target state
with userspace. The kernel and userspace definitions of these structs
differ. Currently, the structs are copied wholesale, then patched up.
The match and target structs contain a kernel pointer. Type-specific
data may contain additional kernel-only state.

Introduce xt_match_to_user and xt_target_to_user helper functions to
copy only fields intended to be shared with userspace.

Introduce xt_data_to_user to do the same for type-specific state. Add
a field .usersize to xt_match and xt_target to define the range of
bytes in .matchsize that should be shared with userspace. All matches
and targets that define kernel-only data store this at the tail of
their struct.

Tested:

  Ran iptables-test.py from iptables.git, with both a 64-bit and
  32-bit compat binary. 603/603 tests passed both before and after
  the patches (out of 705, but some CONFIGs were not enabled).

  Also ran the following example queries manually, again using 64-bit
  and 32-bit compat paths:

  iptables -A INPUT  -m string --algo bm --string 'xxx' -j LOG
  iptables -L
  iptables-save

  ip6tables -A INPUT  -m string --algo bm --string 'xxx' -j LOG
  ip6tables -L
  ip6tables-save

  ebtables -A INPUT --limit 3 -j ACCEPT
  ebtables -L

  arptables -A INPUT --source-mac 00:11:22:33:44:55 -j ACCEPT
  arptables -L

  An instrumented binary that initializes its buffer with 0x66 bytes
  shows the result of the patchset.

  iptables LOG target in hex before and after. The xt_target struct
  only has its size, name and revision specified. Trailing bytes in
  the name field are not zeroed:

  ebtables limit match in hex before and after. Only the avg and burst
  fields of ebt_limit_info are shared.
