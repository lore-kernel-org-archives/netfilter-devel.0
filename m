Yeah, the result feels good enough for me. Here's the latest tcpdump
before I run out of good filenames for the dumps:

IIRC our outbound box does traffic shaping, so some percents are to be=20
accounted to packets being dropped to slow down the connection a bit=20
if they come (in) too fast.

Anyway, we now just have to flip a coin if this gets into the kernel
or not :-) I really hope this could save someone from doing
the same debug session all over again...

Thanks for the hard work you put into debugging this.
