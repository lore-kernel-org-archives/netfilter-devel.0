I don't know the details about IPv6 router implement.
Did you mean that we can not directly use ip6_route_input(skb) to find Routing type(host/router)?

Indeed, after assembling fragments successfully in IPv6 connection track, original fragments are forwarded to IPv6 stack. And then IPv6 stack also assembles those received fragments again.
Thus fragments are assembled twice. 

But IPv4 only assembly once. IPv4 connection track assembles fragments successfully and then just forwards assembled intact packet to IPv4 stack. 
Do you know why is IPv6 designed like that?
