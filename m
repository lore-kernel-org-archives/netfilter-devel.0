Design intent.
You can have the same target instance used by specifying the same index
on the command line.

I like #2. For #1 as long as it doesnt deviate from desire to have one 
or more instances of targets, we should be fine.

My motivation for that question:
Is it possible to ignore the hook and tablename and just use the chain
name?

In general we dont need to worry about netns since actions are attached 
to the filters which are dependent on qdiscs which are dependent on 
netdevs which are per netns.
I believe actions (not filters or qdiscs) have a way where this can
be circumvented in one scenario (I can configure them bypassing the 
filter interface). Thanks for bringing this up - I will look at it.

cheers,
