Hi Michal - 

coincidentally I've been looking into this area this week due to another
bug report (https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60853).  Looking at
your proposed fix, the NAT extension data should have been cleaned
from the bysource list in nf_nat_cleanup_conntrack (via __nf_ct_ext_destroy)
before reaching the kfree.  Would you agree?

The reporter of #60853 suggested adding a synchronize_rcu to the end of the
nf_nat_cleanup_conntrack function, which seems sane.  I have been trying to 
reproduce the crash to test that theory.

Are you able to reproduce an OOPS in your testing?  Or is there a bug report
you are working from?

Phil
