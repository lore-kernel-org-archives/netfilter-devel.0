	This is a slow path, so it does not matter much.
There is no concurrent access to the socket, the only
risk is some call into the stack that checks with lockdep
for the missing lock. Such example but for another lock
we already hold is ASSERT_RTNL in ip_mc_join_group. But for simple
sk vars lock is not needed. You can safely remove locks before
connect/bind if only sk fields are accessed directly.
We can keep it only in join_mcast_group*(), especially
because they are called after bind().

	It is a simple var, so it can work without lock.

	No, here is example from your patch:

        pr_info("sync thread started: state = MASTER, mcast_ifn = %s, "
-               "syncid = %d, id = %d\n",
-               ipvs->mcfg.mcast_ifn, ipvs->mcfg.syncid, tinfo->id);
+                       "syncid = %d, id = %d, maxlen = %d\n",
+                       ipvs->mcfg.mcast_ifn, ipvs->mcfg.syncid,
+                       tinfo->id, ipvs->mcfg.sync_maxlen);

	"syncid = " was at the same column as "sync thread started",
you added another tab, may be to align with the args in new pr_info.
The result is:

	pr_info("sync thread started: state = MASTER, mcast_ifn = %s, "
			"syncid = %d, id = %d, maxlen = %d\n",
			ipvs->mcfg.mcast_ifn, ipvs->mcfg.syncid,
			tinfo->id, ipvs->mcfg.sync_maxlen);
	<--- 2 TABs --->

	But it should be:

	pr_info("sync thread started: state = MASTER, mcast_ifn = %s, "
		"syncid = %d, id = %d, maxlen = %d\n",
		ipvs->mcfg.mcast_ifn, ipvs->mcfg.syncid,
		tinfo->id, ipvs->mcfg.sync_maxlen);
	< 1 TAB>

	Also, the new pr_info calls exceed 80 columns.
May be you can reduce the many spaces.

Regards
