Ok, I see.

You are right - that's faster in the kernel and useless to move it to=20
userspace.

Hm, the main problem (for me) is that it requires more then one value=20
per net device and it should be limited. But if I say it is 5 for=20
instance, anyone can say it is not enough for him.

ip link set ppp0 group 10
also if "ip link set..." works for multiple interfaces it is already=20
done. If it is not, it will affect positively all other settings :)
