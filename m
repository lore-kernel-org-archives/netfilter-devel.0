Aijaz, great! Now it' clear. Thank you.
It remains a problem: the meaning of

fl.nl_u.ip4_u.saddr =3D 0

But, first of all:
- we know that a routing table doesn't contain the ip source
- but the routing cache contains it.

so my first question is: why routing cache has it and routing cache
not? what it its usage?
Then my second question: the meaning of fl.nl_u.ip4_u.saddr =3D 0

thank you very much
