well, I did my best to avoid it, but the guys didn't even bother to
reply. pushing a knowingly broken patch that
	a) kills the build
	b) introduces a race
	c) requires two "Fixes:" followup patches
to the main line despite the fact that those problems were discovered
at linux-next stage is totally un-cool.
