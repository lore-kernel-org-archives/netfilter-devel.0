I've changed the default timeout for OPEN to 12 hours.

Yes, that should be possible. But how does the server know that
the client intends to initiate a connection?

In that case sCR makes most sense since in that state we're
expecting a Close from the client.

The attached patch contains the changes I've made so far
based on your review. I'll go through the remaining points
now.
