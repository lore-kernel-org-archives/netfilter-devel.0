So the question remains what to do instead and how to do it. That
probably is deep Netfilter mojo, so I could only speculate wildly.

We do, as I said in my first mail. Near as I can tell,
nf_conntrack_confirm() is the only function that ever increases
that counter, so it's definitely dropped there. As to how one
could handle it differently, I have to defer to people with more
Netfilter expertise. No point in "fixing" this by breaking other
stuff.
