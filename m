I think that we should be a bit more conservative and add a new option
for this and document this new behaviour, so the user can select what
approach is better according to their needs.

There are protocols that rely on consecutive port allocation to work,
eg. RTP/RCTP, I'm afraid that this full randomization approach will
break them.
