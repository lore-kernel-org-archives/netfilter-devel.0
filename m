  Indeed, a netchannels based implementation would be very nice. Combined 
with a userspace network stack I think this could be a very powerful 
tool, especially for people doing dirty tricks -- like transparent 
proxying in our case.

  However, I think that adopting netchannels now would be an enormous work 
on our part. Of course, personally I'm really interested in netchannels 
and the related projects, but I agree with Harald that we still have a 
long way to go before being able to switch to netchannels. And I 
definitely _hate_ the previous incarnations of our tproxy patches enough 
that even this patchset seems acceptable for me. ;)
