There is one small problem which already was present before this patch
because of my change b6a7719aedd7e5 ("ipv4: hash net ptr into
fragmentation bucket selection"). It uses sock_net in iptunnel_xmit,
which causes a NULL ptr panic. This patchset did make it more visible
because of the explicit NULL passing but the bug was introduced by my
patch.

Just wanted to let you know if reports are coming in - I fix it up
tomorrow. I will also explore the possibility to give each tunnel at
least a raw socket, what Tom proposed.

Rick Jones identified this, thanks!

Bye,
Hannes
