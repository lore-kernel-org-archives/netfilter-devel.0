We'd still be missing the possibility of having only the first packet l=
ogged,
and we'd have to also send an initial netlink message to switch the cop=
y_mode
to COPY_NONE. We're not interested in the actual packet, but just by th=
e match
hit.
I know it's not big deal after all, I'm just trying to have one simple =
target
for that simple task of notifying userspace of a match hit.

That's right, I should have used the ATOMIC gfp flags from my sending r=
outine.
I'll fix that with my next revision of the patch.

Thanks for the review.

Cheers,
Samuel.
