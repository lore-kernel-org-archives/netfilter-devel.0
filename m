Jumping in on this point - the fact that roughly 2/3 of TC actions will
simply BUG under not unlikely circumstances when used in ingress (I went
through them one by one with Pablo a week ago) is also telling. Nobody
seems to be using that. All packet mangling actions will BUG while any
tap is active. Its nothing easily fixed, but apparently nobody has cared
in ten years. ipt is trivial to crash differently, connmark is as well.

So I'm wondering what are we actually arguing about here. Whether we are
affecting the performance how fast TC will crash? We *do* actually care
about these thing, in TC apparently nobody has for the past ten years.
