Trying to compare IPsec policy to netfilter is just plain silly.  IPsec
policy is *not* equivilant to a firewall system like netfilter.  Not
even close.  Not offering the ability to firewall transport-mode IPsec=20
packets shouldn't even be an option. :/  With 15 servers which all talk
transport-mode IPsec to each other I'd still want to be able to do
firewalling to hopefully reduce the impact of one of the servers being
compromised.

I had wanted to do this, in order to hide the network configuration of
the machines behind the gateway but ended up not being able to. :/  My
situation is perhaps not very common but I think it will become more
common in the future: I've got a VPN setup with multiple different
people who I don't completely trust and who don't entirely trust me or
the other people.  This situation can exist for tunnel mode and
transport mode users.  As use-ipsec-when-available transport mode
increases in use this need seems likely to grow.

Consider a corporate network where the whole thing is set up to do
transport-mode ipsec.  Chances are the guys who run the corporate
servers are still going to want to be able to run firewalls on their
servers to cover things in case a given desktop is compromised.

	Thanks,
