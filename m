Look at the policer as an example - already in the kernel. It may decide
to shoot a packet.
The framework is already in since pre-2.6.8. My goal was to wait and
have it stabilize i.e no complaints and then start sending
patches for new actions. I can send you a few if you want to scrutinize
(although to understand the rules posted you dont need to see the
patches)

Let me know if you want me to send you an action or two ;->

The issue i had was two fold:
1) If you plan is to change things in the skb you have to
remember that you must copy or clone them (because you dont know who
else is holding references to the skb and for what purpose)
in which case the skb you manipulate is different from the one you
passed.
i.e no need to pass the reference to achieve that
2) You are making a lot of changes to pass **skb
in order to achieve your goal which doesnt seem strong to begin with.

I didnt quiet parse what you said above - we may be saying the same
thing again. Did my last email (where we seem to sync) cover this?
