Another thought: Instead of storing that bit in the next pointer, we
could require the user to store this bit, i.e. two new function
pointers to rhashtable_params, set_walk_bit() and get_walk_bit(),
which take the hashed object as argument and if a rhashtable user
requires consistent dumps he can provide these functions to store
the flag.
