Thanks your point, I actually did not attention these codes you mentioned.
But I checked the other codes, I think the dangerous may exist.

The expect class is NF_CT_EXPECT_CLASS_DEFAULT, and proto is
IPPROTO_UDP at the function "expect_rtp_rtcp",
And it makes sure the port is even number.

But look at the process_gcf, the port is got from the packet data at
function get_h225_addr.
So it may be odd number.
It also would add one expect node whose class is
NF_CT_EXPECT_CLASS_DEFAULT, and proto is IPPROTO_UDP.

BTW, the loop in nat_rtp_rtcp and nat_rtp_rtcp depend on one potential
condition which is protected by other functions.
It doesn't seem a good style.

Regards
Feng
