Suppose we have the following sequence of events:

1.	CPU 0 is running a task that is using the slab cache.

	This CPU does kmem_cache_free(), which happens to free up
	some memory to the system.  Because SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU is
	set, an RCU callback is posted to do the actual freeing.

	Please note that this RCU callback is internal to the slab,
	so that the slab user cannot be aware of it.  In fact, the
	slab user isn't doing any call_rcu()s whatever.

2.	CPU 0 discovers that the slab cache can now be destroyed.

	It determines that there are no users, and has guaranteed
	that there will be no future users.  So it knows that it
	can safely do kmem_cache_destroy().

3.	In absence of rcu_barrier(), kmem_cache_destroy() would
	immediately tear down the slab data structures.

4.	At the end of the next grace period, the RCU callback posted
	(again, internally by the slab cache) is invoked.  It has a
	coronary due to the slab data structures having already been
	freed, and (worse yet) possibly reallocated for other uses.

Hence the need for the rcu_barrier() when tearing down SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU
slab caches.

Which is irrelevant.  The outstanding RCU callback was posted by the
slab cache itself, -not- by the user of the slab cache.

Unless I am missing something, this patch re-introduces the bug that
the rcu_barrier() was added to prevent.  So, in absence of a better
explanation of what I am missing:

NACK.
