No, the problem is most likely that for outgoing packets, the XFRM
lookup is done with the route lookup before the packet is even sent,
so once it hits the raw or mangle table, it is too late. mangle however
performs rerouting when the mark value changes, at which point a new
XFRM lookup is performed.
