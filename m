So why are you testing it ?

Where is this guaranteed ? The invariant is the refcnt being taken.

I did this RCU conversion, so I think I know what I am talking about.

The entry should not be put into hash table (or refcnt set to 1),
if its not ready. It is that simple.

We need to address this problem without adding an extra test and
possible loop for the lookups.

Whole point of RCU is to make lookups fast, by possibly making the
writers doing all the needed logic.
