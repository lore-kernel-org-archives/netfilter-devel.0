Yes, you are correct only when there is no SNAT rule. If there is an SN=
AT rule:

-t nat -A POSTROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j SNAT --to-source 192.168.0.1

the final tuples will be:
src =3D home dst =3D router src=3D1.2.3.4 dst=3D192.168.0.1

However, the tuple saved by connlimit is src=3D1.2.3.4 dst=3Dhome, so t=
his
conn will be removed later as there isn't any conntrack, which has
this tuple in any direction.

You can't prevent a user from doing such a configuration, although you
might think it is stupid to do that.

Thanks for your review.
