I mean:

[1] mmap()
[1] fill buffers
[1] pthread_create() [creates: 2]
[1] sendmsg() starts
[2] modify buffers
[1] sendmsg() returns

So: no multiple mmaps, and no touching of the fd. I haven't dug into
filesystem layer to see if threads affect file->f_count, but there
sure are no multiple mappings here.
