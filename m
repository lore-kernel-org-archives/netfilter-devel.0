I am wondering, if there are two approaches for matching large amounts of 
addresses (xt_geoip and ipset), why is none of them in the kernel?

I was saying how OpenBSD is better than Linux because OpenBSD has 
tree-based firewall tables --- hmm --- well --- Linux has them too, except 
that noone can really find them because they are not in the kernel.

My code uses 8 bytes per range too, not really per address.
