>The following patch set implement IPv6 fragment handling for IPVS.

I've been running this patch set for a while now I seems to work well.

Netns tests with 4k nets ns have passed without problems (nothing left on loopback)

All tcp/udp fragment test - OK
sctp  didn't pass but that is not related to IPVS.
esp/ah  not affected by this patch, basic tests works fine.
ipvs sync (backup)  - OK

IPv4 DR, Tunnel, NAT - OK
IPv6 DR, Tunnel OK  
IPv6 NAT and Patrick's IPv6 NAT seems to work, however SIP or sipp doesn''t like IPv6 NAT yet

ICMPv6 - "packet to big" works except for
pmtu when using esp/ah, but that didn't work without the patch set either. 

Performance: No noticeable effects

My recommendation is that this patch set OK for inclusion in 3.7 

Thanks for a great work Jesper.
