Those two sound reasonable to me.

The purpose of __net_exit is to mark code that can be __exit if we don't
enable network namespace support.

Looking at the original code it appears that __exit was wrong because
we had __init sections referring to the __exit code and that was
causing modpost to complain.

Now that the definition of __exit_refok has changed half a dozen times
since it was introduced I don't know what will happen.

Since this really isn't about network namespaces but what to do when
the network namespace code is disabled I'm going to bow out now.
