memcmp() is fine, but how is it solving the masking problem we have ?

Also in the case of arp_tables, _a is long word aligned, while _b and _=
mask are not.

memcmp() in this case is slower, (and dont handle mask thing)

If you look various ifname_compare(), we have two different implementat=
ions.

So yes, a factorization is possible for three ip_tables.c, ip6_tables.c=
 and xt_physdev.c
