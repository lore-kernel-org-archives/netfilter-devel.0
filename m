Of course. This has been discussed before.

You need to ensure that no objects are in use before destroying a slab. In
case of DESTROY_BY_RCU you must ensure that there are no potential
readers. So use a suitable rcu barrier or something else like a
synchronize_rcu...

There will be no rcu callbacks generated at kmem_cache_destroy with the
patch I posted.

The "fix" was ill advised. Slab users must ensure that no objects are in
use before destroying a slab. Only the slab users know how the objects
are being used. The slab allocator itself cannot know how to ensure that
there are no pending references. Putting a rcu_barrier in there creates an
inconsistency in the operation of kmem_cache_destroy() and an expectation
of functionality that the function cannot provide.
