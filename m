Hi Pablo,

please consider these bug fixes and extensive clean-ups of IPVS
from Eric Biederman for v4.4.

His excellent description of the changes, which is part of an even larger
set of clean-up work, is as follows:

  I am gradually working my way through the netfilter stack passing struct
  down into the netfilter hooks and from the netfilter hooks and from there
  down into the functions that actually care.  This removes the need for
  netfilter functions to guess how to figure out how to compute which
  network namespace they are in and instead provides a simple and reliable
  method to do so.

  The cleanups stand on their own but this is part of a larger effort to
  have routes with an output device that is not in the current network
  namespace.

  The IPVS code has been a bit more of a challenge than most.  Just passing
  struct net through to where it is needed did not feel clean to me.  The
  practical issue is that the ipvs code in most places actually wants
  struct netns_ipvs and not struct net.

  So as part of this process I have turned the relationship between struct
  net and the structs netns_ipvs, ip_vs_conn_param, ip_vs_conn, and
  ip_vs_service inside out.  I have modified the ipvs functions to take a
  struct netns_ipvs not a struct net.  The net is code with fewer
  conversions from one type of structure to another.  I did wind up adding
  a struct netns_ipvs parameter to quite a few functions that did not have
  it before so I could pass the structure down from the netfilter hooks to
  where it is actually needed to avoid guessing.

  I have broken up the work in a bunch of small patches so there is at
  least a chance and reviewing that each step I took is correct.  The
  series compiles at each step so bisecting it should not be a problem if
  something weird comes up.

  The first two changes in this series are actually bug fixes.  The first
  is a compile fix for a bug in sctp that came in, in the last round of
  ipvs changes merged into nf-next.  The second fixes an older bug where in
  pathological circumstances the wrong network namespace could be used when
  a proc file is written to.

  The rest of the patchset is a bunch of boring changes getting pushing
  struct netns_ipvs (and by extension ipvs->net) where it needs to be.
  Either by replacing struct net pointers or adding new struct netns_ipvs
  pointers.  With a handful of other minor cleanups (like removing
  skb_net).

I have decided include the bug fixes in this pull request. Patch one
relates to a bug that was added to nf-next recently and is thus not
applicable to nf . Patch two could arguably be promoted to a fix for v4.3
and stable though it does not appear to be severe enough to warrant that
course of action; let me know if you would like me to reconsider.
