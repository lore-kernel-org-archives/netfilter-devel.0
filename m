	Great! Only one missing lock:

Patch 3:
	Missing write_[un]lock_bh(&__ip_vs_svc_lock) in ip_vs_flush,
	now we use ip_vs_unlink_service_nolock.

As you are going to create new version you can look also at these:

Patch 5:
	Can you rename 'goto exit;' to 'goto cleanup;' or
	'goto out;'

Patch 6:
	Add at least one comma after 'enabled' here:
	netns(%d) enabled first service added
