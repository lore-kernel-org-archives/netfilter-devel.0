It appears that the patch "ipv6: reassembly: use seperate reassembly
queues for conntrack and local delivery" went to both the 2.6.32 and
2.6.27 stable branches, but the fix from Shan Wei went to the 2.6.32
branch only, not to the 2.6.27 branch. However I checked that it applie=
s
 on the latest 2.6.27 release, and fixes the problem.

Could someone submit it for the next 2.6.27 stable release ? Or if I
have to do it, what is the process ?
Thanks.
