Fixes/suggestion in the help text (near "adda" and subsequent).

config IP6_NF_TARGET_NPT
	tristate "NPT (Network Prefix translation) target support"
	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
	---help---
	This option adds the "SNPT" and "DNPT" targets, which perform stateless
	IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation per RFC 6296.

GNU sometimes has a strange way of expressing their (C) lines,
listing all years separately, as if "1989-1991,1994-1999,2001-2005" was not
sufficient. In your case, would "2011-2012" work?

Any objection to adding a "(or later)" clause to the set?

While the RFC probably only specifies masks up to /64,
the general algorithm is sustainable up to at least /96.

Extending the RFC's section 3.6 ("/48 Prefix Mapping") example,
fd01:0203:0405:0001:0000:0000:0000:1234/112 (specification per `ip
addr`) would become 2001:0db8:0001:0000:0000:0000:d550:1234.

Not everybody runs exclusively on EUI64-SLAAC / PRIVACY addresses :)

IETF did quite a job again... NPT as an acronym is quite
close to NAPT - too close.
Since it's essentially NETMAP, having something in that ballpark
may seem more fitting. NPMAP? (Translation is mapping -
henceforh "Network Prefix Mapping")



I would hint towards choosing a different name; the P in NPT
may be (mis)understood as port (due to the common "NAPT")
keyword.

Should perhaps a  .table = "mangle"  be added?


Are any tricks on the userspace side needed to use SNPT/SNPMAP?
Since I spot no code telling conntrack about the address mingling,
one would have to use -j CT --notrack or the rawpost table, like
it's done for RAWSNAT in xtables-addons, would he not?
