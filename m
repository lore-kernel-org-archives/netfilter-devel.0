Source address selection, having to occur on the source, would
require that the source has to know all the parameters that a {what
would have been your NAT GW} would need to know, which means you have
to (a) collect and/or (b) distribute this information. Given two
uplinks that only allow a certain source network address (different
for each uplink), combined with the desire to balance on utilization,
(a) a client is not in the position to easily obtain this data unless
it is the router for all participants itself, (b) the clients needs
to cooperate, and one cannot always trust client devices, or hope for
their technical cooperation (firewalled themselves off).

Yes, NAT is evil, but if you actually think about it, policies are
best applied where [the policy] originates from. After all, we also
don't do LSRR, instead, routers do the routing, because they just
know much better.

Same network prefix, some cookies, or a login form. Blam, identified,
or at least (Almost-)Uniquely Identified Visitor tagging.

Everybody should come out of their worshipping NAT for anonymity
now - at best, that is an Emperor's Clothes' kind of anonymity.

If one's tor peer was busted, they would have the address.
