Wow! Again I have been totally blind and focusing only in a solution for
the spinlock problem, while using a mutex would ease things up quite a
lot! Thanks for the suggestion, I'll re-spin my patch (pun intended?)
with a mutex.

I also agree that it makes more sense to lookup and store the timer in
the targe.
