I'm not sure why that would be needed.  Finding the net_id list is an operation
of a map relating net namespaces to lists, not contids to lists.  We could do
it, sure, but since they're unrelated operations, I don't think we experience
any slowdowns from doing it this way.

This is true, the list_empty check is redundant, and the for loop will fall
through if the list is empty.

I think this is another way of asking, will multiple processes exist in the same
network namespace?  That is to say, will we expect a process to create a net
namespace, and then have other processes enter that namespace (thereby
triggering multiple calls to audit_netns_contid_add with the same net pointer
and cont id).  Given that the kubernetes notion of a pod is almost by definition
multiple containers sharing a network namespace, I think the answer is that we
will be strongly biased towards the refcount_inc case, rather than the kmalloc
case.  I could be wrong, but I think this is likely already in the optimized
order.

There is a corner case that needs it.  list_add_rcu has a check that gets
called, __list_add_valid.  Its a noop in the regular case, but if
CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST is defined, its a check to ensure that the next and prev
pointers getting passed in aren't set to detectable corrupt values.  If we pass
in garbage, we can get transient false positives on that check, so we need to
set the list pointers to known good values before hand, either by using kzalloc,
or INIT_LIST_HEAD, as has been done here.  Given that we expressly set every
field of this structure, I think this is the right approach, as it uses the list
macro to expressly set the list values to their proper state.
