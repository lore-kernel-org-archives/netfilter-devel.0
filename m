Hi Stephen,

[I see that you have cutted my name proposal from the original email,
which might make it difficult for others to follow. I will assume you
did it by mistake.]

[PATCH] netfilter: use bh disabling with per-cpu read-write lock

Reading Documentation/spinlocks.txt, which states the lock usage
guidelines :

"Note that you can be clever with read-write locks and interrupts. For
example, if you know that the interrupt only ever gets a read-lock, then
you can use a non-irq version of read locks everywhere - because they
don't block on each other (and thus there is no dead-lock wrt interrupts.
But when you do the write-lock, you have to use the irq-safe version."

So it's assumed in the kernel-wide read lock usage that nested read
locks are OK. I'm adding Thomas and Steven in CC, but I'm quite sure
they must have dealt with nested read-lock transformation into mutexes
by detecting nesting in some way in -rt. But I'll let them confirm this.

So I don't see why you are dreaming about a different semantic than the
one of the primitives you are using. I guess I'll leave the semantics to
you. I just find it astonishing that you persist saying that everbody is
wrong on a topic like semantic, which is in the end a mean to
communicate ideas clearly within the overall community you disagree
with.

Good luck !

Mathieu
