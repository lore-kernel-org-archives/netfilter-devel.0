Sure, (((u64) hash * qcount) >> 32) happens to be
reciprocal_divide(hash, qcount) but the result depends on hash being
well distributed in [0 .. ~0U] space.

So 'reciprocal' and 'divide' do not accurately describe this exact
operation.

I suggest making the thing more descriptive.

(And discussed on lkml btw)
