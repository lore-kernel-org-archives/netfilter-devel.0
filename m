Looking again at your code:

        case NFULNL_COPY_PACKET:
-               if (inst->copy_range > skb->len)
+               data_len = inst->copy_range;
+               if (li->u.ulog.copy_len < data_len)
+                       data_len = li->u.ulog.copy_len;

data_len is set to instance's copy_range.

But then, if the NFLOG rule indicates smaller copy_len, you use this
value. So to my understanding, NFLOG rule prevails over instance's
copy_range in what matters, which is to shrink the copy range.

Currently, li->u.ulog.copy_len is set to "0" by default when not
specified.

But copy_len = 0 is a valid possibility, so this looks a bit more
tricky to me to fix since we may need to get flags here to know when
this is set.

Probably something like:

        if (li->flags & NF_LOG_F_COPY_RANGE)
                data_len = li->u.ulog.copy_len;
        /* Per-instance copy range prevails over global per-rule option. */
        if (data_len < inst->copy_range)
                data_len = inst->copy_range;
        if (data_len > skb->len)
                data_len = skb->len;

Although this would require a bit more code to introduce these flags.

You will also need a new flag for xt_NFLOG:

#define XT_NFLOG_COPY_LEN       0x2

it seems other XT_NFLOG_* flags were already in place.

Interesting that nobody noticed this for so long BTW.
