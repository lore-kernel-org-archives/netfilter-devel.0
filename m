Thanks for this detailed bugreport and fix.

Not that I'm aware of.

Since I don't want to put any more conntrack-specific code into the core
network stack, I'd rather go for the 'alternative patch'.

I'm not sure whether it's worth the effort to combine the two, i.e. only
flush entries with skb->dst =3D=3D NULL.

But especially since module unloading is EXPERIMENTAL anyway, I think
it's ok when we completely flush the fragemnt queue.

Dave, is this fine with you?  What solution would you prefer?
