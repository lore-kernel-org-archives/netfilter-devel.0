Hi Pablo,

please consider pulling
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/horms/ipvs.git master
to get the following fix from Julian.

The bug in question has been present since 2.6.37 and accordingly I would
like the fix considered for both 3.3 and stable. I have confirmed that it
applies and builds against your net tree, 3.2.2, 3.1.10, 3.0.18 and 2.6.39.4.
