Sure.

When the file is compiled, i.e. CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_REDIRECT is
selected, all headers will be included and all functions inside the file
will be compiled, regardless of other Kconfig options.

This means redirect_tg6 and redirect_tg4 will be compiled (which doesn't
necessarily mean they will be _called_) but the linker needs to resolve
nf_nat_redirect_ipv4() due to the compilation of the redirect_tg4()
function.

nf_nat_redirect_ip4() is defined in
net/ipv4/netfilter/nf_nat_redirect_ipv4.c but this file is only included
into the build when CONFIG_NF_NAT_REDIRECT_IPV4 is enabled.

Now when a kernel config enables CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_REDIRECT but
_not_ CONFIG_NF_NAT_REDIRECT_IPV4, the declaration of
nf_nat_redirect_ipv4() from the header
<net/netfilter/ipv4/nf_nat_redirect.h> will have no definition (i.e., no
implementation), causing the linker to report an "undefined reference".

Same logic goes for nf_nat_redirect_ipv6().

Hope this helps,

Andreas
