I used the following:

0) netns is currently mutually exclusive with sysfs, so depending on
   sanity of distro initscripts booting sysfs-less kernel can be tricky.

   In Gentoo, for example a) rm -rf /sys (sic!), b) RC_USE_FSTAB="yes",
   c) RC_DEVICES="static" in /etc/conf.d/rc are needed.

1) netns creation tool (attached, some container guy posted it somewhere)

	# ns_exec -n /bin/sh

2) shutdown network in init_net

	sudo /etc/init.d/ntpd stop
	sudo /etc/init.d/sshd stop
	sudo /etc/init.d/iptables stop
	sudo /etc/init.d/ip6tables stop
	sudo /etc/init.d/net.eth1 stop
	sudo /etc/init.d/net.eth0 stop

3) move netdevices to netns

	ip l s dev eth0 netns "$1"
	ip l s dev eth1 netns "$1"

	where $1 is PID of shell from 1)

4) in netns start everything back

	sudo /etc/init.d/net.eth0 start
	sudo /etc/init.d/net.eth1 start
	sudo /etc/init.d/iptables start
	sudo /etc/init.d/ip6tables start
	sudo /etc/init.d/sshd start
	sudo /etc/init.d/ntpd start

5) at this point my usual NAT setup is back working for me and everything should
   be like in init_net (modulo aforementioned exceptions) and
   independent from init_net.

Leaked netns are in /proc/slabinfo under "net_namespace".

Some IPv6 printks can be annoying, so mute them.

Object poisoning with SLUB won't work for irrelevant reasons, so use SLAB.

Something like that.
