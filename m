It seems ip_conntrack did not like the SYN/ACK and marked it as invalid,
NAT leaves the packet alone and the firewall resets the connection.
Please try if loading the ipt_LOG module and executing
"echo 255 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_log_invalid"
gives more information

Please also try this again with logging enabled.

Can you retest with 2.6.12.5 on 64bit so we can see if it is a new
problem?

So far I don't think its related to routed.
