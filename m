I could have still looked to it :-), I can mostly decide anything TCP 
congestion control related based on solely a tcpdump, and I can even read 
tcpdump -n -r logfile output if you want to fully hide any payloads (as 
long as the lines are not split to a mess in an email :-)) though then 
plotting them is not as easy for me (I could hack my tool someday though 
to handle that as well).

But if there is pre-2.6.25.7/2.6.26 kernel involved, then it's obsolete 
one and requires upgrade or the relevant fixes from 2.6.25.7.

I already sent it, though vger was in some sort of distress, so it might 
take some time to arrive...

Could you just tcpdump over (at least) one stall? ...That would be useful 
even if you find the patch I sent working because it's always possible 
that something has been overlooked in FRTO spec or so and I would like to 
understand the problem rather than just use a workaround which was 
intented to fix (possibly) other problem...

If there's something I cannot figure out from the dump, I'll then consult 
you about the userspace details.
