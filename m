This isn't really your fault but netlink_dump_start() has an
enormous number of arguments.

Several of them are zero or NULL in all except one special situation.

An entire argument is a lot of overhead for one situation to impose on
all the others.

I have no objection to the data callback scheme, it's just that
the argument list of this interface is getting out of control.

Usually, in situations like this, we have some control structure
that holds all the control state and we pass that in instead.

	struct netlink_dump_control c = { .dump = dump, .done = done, ... };

	netlink_dump_start(..., &c);

It could be perhaps used here to get things back under control.
