I think we need some of them -- when I just dropped the results of 'make
headers_install' into the iptables build directory, it complained of a
number of them being missing (which I showed a few days ago).

Ideally, the contents of the include/linux/ directory in the iptables
tree would be identical to what you get in usr/include/linux/netfilter*
after running 'make headers_install'.
