I don't think that the NFNOTIF infrastructure fulfill the policy for
inclusion. It seems to me like something quite specific for your needs.
It is simple, yes, but we already have this feature into the kernel. I
don't think that this will reduce CPU usage considerably with regards to
the NFLOG way.

I would still prefer adding the once-per-matching notification feature
to NFLOG than these extra lines in the kernel, Patrick?
