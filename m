I actually like this feature. Matching on names in iptables
has always been one of the major bottlenecks, taking
(according to my last measurement, which is some time ago)
about 1-2% of the total performance. This is of course in
large parts because the interface match is present on *every*
rule, but still some way to logically group interfaces seems
useful to me, not only for iptables, but also for routing rules,
traffic classifiers, af_packet sockets etc.

I'm working on the incremental ruleset changing API BTW :)
One of the changes will be that interface matching is not
a default part of every rule, and without wildcards it will
use the ifindex. But since the cost of this feature seems
pretty low, I don't see a compelling reason against it.
