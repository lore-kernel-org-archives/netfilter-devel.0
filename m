Hello,

Here v2 of the xt_condition patch, it contains some changes suggested by Jan.

When these patches get accepted, I'll send the implementation of the condition
target, as discussed before.

In RFC v2 I've made a few changes as discussed in the review:

  * Removed per-netns module parameters
  * Use par->net instead of current->nsproxy->net_ns
  * Fix file-leak in procfs when exiting the netns

I didn't get any more comments in RFC v2, so I assume it is okay to send it for
inclusion.

>From [RFC v2] to [PATCH], I've only rebased and added a new patch to support
u32 instead of boolean as the value for the condition.

In PATCH v2:

  * Bumped up the revision to 2
  * Changed the buffer declaration to have the size of the biggest possible u32 string
  * Return -ERANGE instead of -EINVALID when the value passed is too big.

Cheers,
Luca.
