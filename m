Then this is another problem.

We cannot use RCU at all here.

Or we miss valid entries in the chain.

RCU should be used where needed, in fast path only, to find one entry,
not to find _all_ entries.

=46or example, we cannot use it for UDP multicast delivery for the same
reasons : If we find a deleted or moved socket, we must restart the loo=
p
and forget all accumulated sockets.

If netlink dumps each entry in the final destination container, then we
cannot restart loop, and cannot use RCU for chain lookup.
