I completely agree that this RCU is absolutely -not- 2.6.30 material.  =

Very cool!!!  If I had seen this, I had forgotten about it.  I will
give it a try, but only after getting it working the old way.  (What,
me paranoid?)

Hmmmm...  But x86 can still execute a later load before an earlier
store, so it seems to me that there would be the potential for even
an x86 CPU to pull loads from the critical section up before the final
store of the percpu_sub(), right?  If so, we really do still need the
IPIs on x86.
