Right, but in that path we still have entries in the table.

I don't mind about placing this or there, as I said, my question is
how often we will hit this optimization in a real scenario.

If you think the answer is often, then this will help.

Otherwise, every time we'll go container destruction path, we'll hit
slow path, ie.  scanning the full table.

OK.
