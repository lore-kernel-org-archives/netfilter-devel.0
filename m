This check assumes that the following headers cannot show up in the
fragmented part of the IPv6 packet:

 12 bool ipv6_ext_hdr(u8 nexthdr)
 13 {
 14         /*
 15          * find out if nexthdr is an extension header or a protocol
 16          */
 17         return   (nexthdr == NEXTHDR_HOP)       ||
 18                  (nexthdr == NEXTHDR_ROUTING)   ||
 19                  (nexthdr == NEXTHDR_FRAGMENT)  ||
 20                  (nexthdr == NEXTHDR_AUTH)      ||
 21                  (nexthdr == NEXTHDR_NONE)      ||
 22                  (nexthdr == NEXTHDR_DEST);
