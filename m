yes, I'm well aware of that.

Because it's needed for interoperability with other IPsec
implementations, in other words if you are not running Linux on both
ends.  Yes, I know... in an ideal world everybody would run linux on
both ends... but if you do: Why use IPsec at all, if not for
interoperability.

oh well, what you are describing are entries in the routing table,
that's fine.  I thought you were talking about hacking the routing code.

well, this is just like the 2.6.x ipsec implementation is like.  It's
not the netfilter project's will or task to change that implementation.
We just want to get the same netfilter/iptables functionality,
independent of somebody using ipsec or not.

yes, but as stated above, other implementations might not be able to
work with that implementation.

Unfortunately there is no simple or easy solution.  We just want to get
it working at all.

I think you would see the packet even more often:

1) LOCAL_OUT of original packet=20
2) POST_ROUTING of original packet
3) LOCAL_OUT of tunnelled packet
4) POST_ROUTING of tunneled packet
5) LOCAL_OUT of ESP/AH packet
6) POST_ROUTING of ESP/AH packet

yes, but I'd rather don't put both of them into one patch.

Again, I misunderstood you.  I do not intend to change the IPsec
implementation in any way, I just want netfilter to acommodate it.=20

What do you mean by that?  From my point of view, it should be like
(1-6) above.   This way anybody can filter on any kind of header bit at
any layer of the encapsulation.=20
