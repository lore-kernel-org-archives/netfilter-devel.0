Hi

irqsafe_cpu_{dec|inc} are used in network stack since 2.6.37 (commit
29b4433d991c88), and I would like to use irqsafe_cpu_add() in netfilter
fast path too, and SNMP counters eventually (to lower ram needs by 50%)

Initial support of irqsafe_ was given by Christoph in 2.6.34

It seems only x86 arch is using a native and efficient implementation.

Others use irqsafe_cpu_generic_to_op() and its pair of
local_irq_save() / local_irq_restore()

Which other arches could use a native implementation ?

What about defining a HAVE_FAST_IRQSAFE_ADD ?

Thanks
