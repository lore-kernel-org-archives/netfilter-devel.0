Ok, sorry for all the noise.  I had a problem between chair and keyboard
which can explain the number of useless revs of this patch...  v6 is
current with potentially v7 with the inline hunk below...

This is also true with netlink_setsockopt() in the
NETLINK_{ADD,DROP}_MEMBERSHIP case, where on ADD we should call
netlink_bind() but on DROP we should *not* call it and instead call
netlink_unbind() afterwards, perhaps such as:

So netlink_setsockopt() was right, but ADD/DROP need slightly different
treatment.

netlink_bind() just needs to undo netlink_bind() on error.

We could do all we wanted in audit, but that would still not signal
netlink to block that subscription.
