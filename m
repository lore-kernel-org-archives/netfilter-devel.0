That's what I implemented as "iptables-restore --noflush" a number of years
ago. It doesn't flush the current uleset and swaps in a new one, but=20
reads the current rules from kernel, applies any number of changes and swaps
the new ruleset in.

The syntax of iptables-restore is almost identical to iptables commands, you
just specify the table in a different way.  So you would just create your
desired changes in that format, and echo that into iptables-restore.  If it=
's
an entire new ruleset, you use no '--noflush' and it does automatic flushing
of all old rules.  If your stdin-file contains only incremental changes, you
use --noflush.

In the netfilter project, we knew for many years that the 'swap the entire
table atomically in' is a bad design choice.  This is what various develope=
rs
have been trying to address at different times, and which finally resulted
in the nftables implementation of Patrick McHardy.  So for the mid- to long
term there is a clear design that moves away from that.

But so far, we have to live with the API and its semantics.  iptables users=
pace
has been improved a number of times, and things like iptables-restore with =
or
without --noflush can be used as an intermediate solution - and have been u=
sed
by many systems out there.
