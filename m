How does that work? I assume in combination with some kind of
rate-limit?

I don't like the current way such things are implemented in iptables
(have all logic in the kernel instead of just providing a mechanism
for implementing it in userspace and presenting a nice view to the
administrator). Thats not your fault of course and your module is
also not the first one to do this.

Unfortunately its most likely not possible to convince me to like
this, so lets just say that I'm fine with merging it if someone
speaks up in favour of it :)

Yes, but I don't want to add another interface netfilter userspace
has to know about. It should either use nfnetlink and remove the proc
interface, or remove the connector interface and use proc.
Preferrably the former.
