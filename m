This is exactly my problem : The driver of the network card I am using
(see rt2x00.serialmonkey.com) do the minimum in the hardware interrupt
(not filling skb->tstamp). Then netif_rx() is called later using a
tasklet (also not filling skb->tstamp). As it seem to me (maybe I am
wrong, if so please tell), the elapse time between the actual frame
arrival and the time where netif_rx() do net_timestamp(skb) is not
predicable !?

Else, I would like to thank you to spend time helping me.
