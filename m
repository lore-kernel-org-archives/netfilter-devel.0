	It does not grow:

	It stays in this value for a long time.

	The time is constant. It takes just 3 seconds to nmap to
"solve" the problem. I always have to use Ctrl+C to stop nmap before it
completes the scanning because in the first 3 seconds the problem is
"solved".

	Would it be useful if I do the same for port 119? Because inn
(nntp) stalls too. And proftp too. So I'm sure it isn't related to
dovecot, otherwise the other services wouldn't stall too.

	The dovecot-auth I use for postfix too.

	Ok, at next stall I'll do that.

	Maybe it's good to strace inn and proftp too, right?

	Don't you think it's interesting that http (apache) and ssh never stal=
ls?
