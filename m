Hello,

This is the 3rd version of interface group patches.

Each net_device structure has a non-negative ifgroup member indicating
the group it belongs to. In the ip tool it is between 0 and 256 where
0 means it is unset.

Usage:
   ip link set eth0 group 4
   ip lonk set eth0 group 0        # to unset
   ip link set eth0 group intra    # named groups

In /etc/iproute2/rt_ifgroup each value may have a symbolic name.

Netfilter part: xt_ifgroup module for both IPv4 and IPv6. Iptables usage:
   iptables -A INPUT -m ifgroup --in-ifgroup 4/0xf -j ACCEPT
   iptables -A FORWARD -m ifgroup --in-ifgroup 4 --out-ifgroup 5 -j ACCEPT
   ...

in the FORWARD chain both input and output interface group value should be matched
(with optional masks).

The following patches are:
  kernel: single notification, atomic changes
  kernel: core part
  kernel: netfilter module, ifgroup match
  iproute2: showing and set ifgroup value
  iptables: ifgroup match

Attila
