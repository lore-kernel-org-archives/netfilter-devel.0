Just wanted to ping folks on this patch, as I haven't gotten any feedback.

As its a prereq for the seqcount lockdep support, I'd like to get it
queued/merged, but I'm not sure what the right maintainer path or
approach should be.

1) Do folks prefer to see this patch split up into 30-some separate
trivial clenaup patches, or have it go in all as one logical change?

2) Would folks want this patch (in whichever form) to be merged
separately via the networking maintainers, or can it be merged via -tip
as part of the seqcount lockdep series?

thanks
