I agree that for 2.6.30, we could use a per-cpu spinlock as your last p=
atch did,
this would be very risky to push this new RCU right now.=20

But this new stuff looks very promising, (no more locked ops on fast pa=
th),
and considering new percpu_{add|sub...} infra, very fast :

static inline void rcu_read_unlock_fgp(void)
{
	barrier();
	percpu_sub(rcu_fgp_active_readers, 1); /* one instruction on x86 */
	preempt_enable();
}

I wonder if IPI are really necessary on x86 if we use percpu_sub() sinc=
e
it already contains a barrier, and rcu_read_lock_fgp(void) also ends wi=
th
a barrier() call...
