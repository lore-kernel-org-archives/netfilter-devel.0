Well, I didn't think I had multiple namespaces, and in fact I don't see
more than one in gdb when I poke at the net struct. What I see libvirt
doing (very oddly indeed - looking at the source now) is calling ip and
asking for the lo device to be moved into the netns for pid "-1", which
isn't valid AFAIK (should be a valid pid, unless "-1" is supposed to be
"this process" or something, haven't played with multiple namespaces).

I'll do some more digging (network stuff isn't my area) now and come
back. It only reproduces if multiple VMs start at once (hence a race,
perhaps as you describe) whereas if I disable autostart and let them
come up one at a time, the box doesn't roll over.

Jon.
