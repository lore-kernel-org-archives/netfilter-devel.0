Okay, thanks for the explanation! I'll have to figure something else out
then.

What I don't understand is that I see lots of components, which have
nothing to do with security, making this kind of checks.  Most of them
(if not all) are checking for input from userspace where they provide
their own interfaces (eg. ioctl calls, netlink messages).

I can see that ip_tables checks for this capability when it gets "set"
socket calls.  Now, with the xt_condition, we're opening a new route
from userspace to the kernel and I think it might be a good idea to
protect that too.

It's kind of useless to protect someone without CAP_NET_ADMIN from
creating a condition rule if it is possible to change the condition from
userspace without any capability protection.

Yeah, my company can do whatever they want with the product.  But my
role here is to work with upstream, so if you guys think that what I'm
doing is total bulls*it, I'll have to go back to the drawing board and
restart my work ;)

Again, I must stress that I really appreciate your comments and help.  I
know I can get good advice from people who are millions of times more
experienced in this area than I am (and yes, that's *you* ;) -- and this
is one of the various reasons I send my patches to netfilter-devel in
the first place.  Another reason is that I want to contribute my work
(however shitty it is) to an eventual benefit for the community as a
whole. :)

Cheers,
Luca.
