Either an exit function references only permitted code (in which case
it is legitimately using __exit), or it references non-__exit code, in
which case it shouldn't have an override at all. Permitting an exit
function to reference e.g. __init code is suspicious (at best) in all
cases I can think of (in contrast to allowing a non-init function to
reference __init code on a code path that can be proven to be taken
only during system startup).
