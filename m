I think this is a very important point.

I can see no serious argument against this behavior, especially for
output.  On input, there is an argument of paranoia about seeing
plaintext packets, but administrator could do this anyways with
tcpdump or custom kernel module if this system is the decapsulation
point.

I've read over Patrick's two most recent postings of these patches
and I think they are generally sane and I cannot find any holes in
them.  Herbert brought up the legitimate concern about defragmentation,
but I think that's a detail and does not take away from the structural
soundness of Patrick's approach.
