Hi Patrick.

Yes, it is TCP specific module.

I'm not sure it is that simple. OSF uses common rules database
shared with OpenBSD (and other *BSDs as well), so converting it into u32
match would require noticeble efforts. But in theory it is probably
doable.

This module was created way before genetlink was ever designed (on
behalf of connector btw :)

Also I do not know why we want to remove connector in favour of
genetlink, since the former is much simpler to work with. Connector
logging is optional in OSF.
