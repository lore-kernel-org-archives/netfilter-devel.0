ok.

To accelerate matters i've committed the new API patch into a 
new standalone topic branch: tip:timers/new-apis.

Unless there are objections or test failures, you (or Stephen or 
David) can then git-pull it into the networking tree via the Git 
coordinates below - and you'll get this single commit in a 
surgical manner - no other timer changes are included.

Doing so has the advantage of:

- You not having to wait a kernel cycle for the API to go
  upstream.

- You can also push it upstream without waiting for the timer 
  tree. (the timer tree and the networking tree will share the 
  exact same commit)

- It will also all merge cleanly with the timer tree in 
  linux-next, etc.

I'd suggest to do it in about a week, to make sure any after 
effects have trickled down and to make sure the topic has become 
append-only. You can ping Thomas and me about testing/review 
status then, whenever you want to do the pull.

You can pull the latest timers/new-apis git tree from:

   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/linux-2.6-tip.git timers/new-apis

 Thanks,
