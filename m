Hi David,

The following patchset contains Netfilter/IPVS fixes for 3.8-rc7, they =
are:

* Fix oops in IPVS state-sync due to releasing a random memory area due
  to unitialized pointer, from Dan Carpenter.

* Fix SCTP flow establishment due to bad checksumming mangling in IPVS,
  from Daniel Borkmann.

* Three fixes for the recently added IPv6 NPT, all from YOSHIFUJI Hidea=
ki,
  with an amendment collapsed into those patches from Ulrich Weber. The=
y
  fiix adjustment calculation, fix prefix mangling and ensure LSB of
  prefixes are zeroes (as required by RFC).

Specifically, it took me a while to validate the 1's complement arithme=
tics/
checksumming approach in the IPv6 NPT code.

It's fairly late stage, so let me know if you can still pull these from=
:

git://1984.lsi.us.es/nf master

Thanks!
