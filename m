No.

After zap_pid_namespace interesting...

I have to say that the semantics of my patch are unworkable for
unshare.  Unless I am mistaken for PAM to use it requires that the
current process fully change and become what it needs to be.
Requiring an extra fork to fully complete the process is a problem.

Scratch one bright idea.
