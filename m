OK, that will do it!!!  ;-)

One way of throttling the bad effects of updates on readers is to
periodically force updates through a grace period.  But this seems
to be a very big hammer, and likely to have little practical effect.

Another approach would be to have multiple list pointers per element,
so that a given element could be reused a small number of times without
messing up concurrent readers (sort of like Herbert's resizable hash
table).

But as you say, if some other bug is really behind this, better to fix
that bug than to work around it.
