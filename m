Phew. Not being broken itself is a win :)

And that is an opinion I will respect. I don't want to muck the git
history where it is significant.

This effort is to eventually replace the uses of
smp_read_barrier_depends() and to use either rcu or
lockless_dereference() as documented in memory-barriers.txt.

That does not need to change as it is fine as it is. It still pairs
with the smp_read_barrier_depends() in lockless_dereference().

I think this is a matter of opinion. But in the current effort I've
seen cases where it is not clear what the barrier is actually
guaranteeing. I am glad that the current code is not one of those and
it has reasonable comments.

lockless_dereference() on the other hand makes the dependency explicit.
