I had been meaning to bring this up from another perspective.

In networking, we often only ever access objects in base or
BH context.  Therefore in BH context cases we can do just
normal counter bumps without any of the special atomic or
IRQ disabling code at all.

This would help non-x86 architectures a lot, and depending upon
how the non-atomic case performs perhaps x86 too.
