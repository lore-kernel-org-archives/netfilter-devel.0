Yes. But my observation was that for the same amount of packets
sent locally the CPU usage is significantly higher than if they
are forwarded from physical interface. That's what made me
curious.

If I had remember that icmp conn track entries get pruned right
when they get icmp reply back, I would not have probably bothered
to bug you. But that made me think it was more of generic problem
than my patch.

I patched ipmr.c to explicitly call dev_hard_header to setup the
ipgre nbma receiver. Sadly, the call was wrong side of the nf_hook.
Adjusting that makes the forward hooks look ok.

I thought hook was using network_header to figure out where the
IP header is, but looks like that isn't the case.

Broken by me as explained.

Hmm... Looking at the code I probably broke this too. Could missing
this hook have a performance penalty for future packets for the
same flow?

Ok. I'll go back to drawing board. I should have done the
multicast handling for nbma destinations on ip_gre side as I was
wondering earlier. I'll also double check with oprofile the local
sendto() approach where it dies.
