It is used all over the stack. Lets defer this part of the 
discussion - even if we never "fix" this it doesnt matter.

I am not sure i followed.

The policer (or any other action) accounts for what passes through it. 
Dropping packets at the policer is policy definition. Dropping packets
at the qdisc due to full queue is an accident. An accident that in
a good system shouldnt happen. For the accident part i agree with
the unbilling/recompensation feature.
I do agree with you - I think we have some bad accounting practises at
the qdisc level. Look at the requeu accounting for another example.
I also have issues with some of the other stats, example
stats.packets should really be incremented on enqueue to account for 
all the packets enqueue has seen (instead it is an accounting for
how many success have happened)

Yes, this is a hard question. Did you see the suggestion i proposed
to Harald?

I mean it is grabbed from the qdisc and a DMA of the packet is
attempted.

I have been thinking about the lock cost. I believe the cost of using
stats lock at qdisc is the same as what you have currently with
unbilling.

Ok, now you mention the other piece. What are you trying to do on said
qdisc?

Explain what your qdisc is doing.
