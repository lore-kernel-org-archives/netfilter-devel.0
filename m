Sounds good, applied, thanks.

A couple of questions: Does it really make sense to expose
--hashlimit-rate-interval or are you using 1 second always there? I
always wonder if it makes sense to expose yet another toggle that it's
not clear to me how the user would take advantage from this.

Just curious here.
