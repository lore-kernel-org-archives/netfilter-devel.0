My gut-feeling is that per netns makes more sense.

I'm unsure what you are asking here but I will make a general statement
about locking in IPVS: it needs work.

Unfortunately the patches don't apply with the persistence engine
patches which were recently merged into nf-next-2.6 (although
"[patch v4.1 ]ipvs: IPv6 tunnel mode" is still unmerged).

I'm happy to work with you to make the required changes there.

(I realise those patches weren't merged when you made your post.
 But regardless, either your or me will need to update the patches).

Another issue is that your patches seem to be split in a way
where the build breaks along the way. E.g. after applying
patch 1, the build breaks. Could you please split things up
in a manner such that this doesn't happen. The reason being
that it breaks bisection.

Lastly, could you provide a unique subject for each patch.
I know its a bit tedious, but it does make a difference when
browsing the changelog.
