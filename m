How about merging the patches that everybody has agreed on first?

So far, I haven't see any objections to patches 1 and 2 so they
can go in straight away.  They don't even touch IPv6.

Patches 3-6 could become redundant if you go with my suggestion.

The rest of them I haven't read yet so can't comment :)

Cheers,
