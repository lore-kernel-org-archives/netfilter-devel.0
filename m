That won't work, as the goal is to have the exit functions call from
__net_init iiuc.

Bogus in what way?

Since __exit functions won't ever be called when built in, they can as
well be marked __init and thus become possible to call from __init code
(again iiuc). Perhaps this should even become a concept outside of
net/, as not marking exit code __exit just because is also gets called
on error paths from __init is not uncommon. Maybe it should even be
__exit itself to get changed that way (albeit I vaguely recall that
differences between arches of when .exit.* sections get discarded
might need further consideration), as long as no arch would get
penalized in that it discards .exit.* but not .init.* post-boot.
