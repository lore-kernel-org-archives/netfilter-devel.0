This makes good sense. I normally look at these in wireshark with
relative sequence numbers turned on, and I see in bad/tun0.pcap that the
SACK values are very high, but are normal in bad/remote.pcap.

I see the same thing in good/tun0.pcap, though, so I don't fully
understand what is making it work sometimes and not others.

I will show this thread and the Cisco docs to the network engineer at
work, and maybe we can get the SEQ randomization turned off (or at least
test it).

I'll keep my eye out and test them if they come up.


Thanks,
