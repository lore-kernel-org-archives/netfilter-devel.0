Maybe state oughta be carried somehow from where the packets "starts"
(eg application/L4 level) or ingress of system. This may complicate
things - will need a lot more thinking (but is worth thinking about).

Ok, in this case, retransmissions have to be unbilled.
To rewind to what i said a few emails ago:
The best place to bill is by looking at what comes out of the box;->
Ok, we dont have that luxury in this case. So the next best place
is to do it at the qdisc level. Because only at that level do you
know for sure if packets made it out or not. 
Since contracking already does the job of marking the flow, then
thats the second part of your requirement "on behalf of each flow".
What we are doing now is hacking around to try and reduce the injustice.

Conclusion: The current way of billing is _wrong_. The better way is to
have contracking just mark and the qdisc decide on billing or unbilling.
Have a billing table somewhere indexed by flow that increments these
stats.

For now i think that focussing on just sch.drops++ in case of full 
queue will help.

Let me cut email here for readability.

cheers,
