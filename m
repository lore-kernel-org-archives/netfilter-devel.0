Oh, ok.  I thought you had already submitted it to upstream in Apr 21.
As I understood from that thread, you were going to make the necessary
changes and resubmit:

But I never saw a follow up to that email (or at least I couldn't find
it in any archives).  Then a few days ago I asked you if you were going
to resend and you answered:

So I assumed you would resubmit it for upstream inclusion.  I probably
misunderstood something in the way then ;)

Sure, I also agree that patches should be small and incremental.
Especially since the xt_condition already exists elsewhere, I think it's
best to get it included upstream as is and then start improving it with
subsequent patches.

I think the best idea will be to send a patchset with the three patches
at once (original xt_condition, plus the target patch, plus the 32-bit
patch).

Heh! And myself, as a newbie, certainly don't want to do that. ;)
