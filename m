Ah nice catch, that seems to be the problem. When the untracked
conntrack is already attached to an skb and thus has refcnt > 1
and we re-initalize the refcnt, it will get freed.

The question is whether the ct_net pointer of the untracked conntrack
is actually required. If so, we need one instance per namespace,
otherwise we can just move initialization and cleanup to the init_net
init/cleanup functions. Alexey, do you happen to know this?
