Thanks for your feedback!

Could you elaborate on "Wouldn't it be more logical to implement netfilter
rule to match the target cgroup paths?". I don't think (or hope) you mean
some string comparison on the dentry path here? :) With our proposal, we
have in the network stack's critical path only the following code that is
being executed here to match the cgroup ...

static bool
cgroup_mt(const struct sk_buff *skb, struct xt_action_param *par)
{
	const struct xt_cgroup_info *info = par->matchinfo;

	if (skb->sk == NULL)
		return false;

	return (info->id == skb->sk->sk_cgrp_fwid) ^ info->invert;
}

... where ``info->id == skb->sk->sk_cgrp_fwid'' is the actual work, so very
lightweight, which is good for high loads (1Gbit/s, 10Gbit/s and beyond), of
course. Also, it would be intuitive for admins familiar with other subsystems
to just set up and use these cgroup ids in iptabels. I'm not yet quite sure
how your suggestion would look like, so you would need to setup some "dummy"
subgroups first just to have a path that you can match on?

Thanks,

Daniel
