I see. Strange that no one has adressed this yet - I mean, writing
a just-too-large value into a procfs/sysfs file and thus effectively
causing a bogus value to be actually written isn't quite so thrilling
as things go haywire.

If I read strtoul(3) right, ERANGE is used for "out of range".

Indeed.
