My primary goal with this patchset and it's follow ups is to cleanup the
network routing paths so that we do not look at the output device to
derive the network namespace.  My plan is to pass the network namespace
of the transmitting socket through the output path, to replace code that
looks at the output network device today.  Once that is done we can have
routes with output devices outside of the current network namespace.
Which should allow reception and transmission of packets in network
namespaces to be as fast as normal packet reception and transmission
with early demux disabled, because it will same code path.

Once skb_dst(skb)->dev is a little better under control I think it will
also be possible to use rcu to cleanup the ancient hack that sets
dst->dev to loopback_dev when a network device is removed.

The work to get there is a series of code cleanups.  I am starting with
passing net into the netfilter hooks and into the functions that are
called after the netfilter hooks.  This removes from netfilter the
need to guess which network namespace it is working on.

To get there I perform a series of minor prep patches so the big changes
at the end are possible to audit without getting lost in the noise.  In
particular I have a lot of patches computing net into a local variable
and then using it through out the function.

So this patchset encompases removing dead code, sorting out the _sk
functions that were added last time someone pushed a prototype change
through the post netfilter functions.  Cleaning up individual functions
use of the network namespace.  Passing net into the netfilter hooks.
Passing net into the post netfilter functions.  Using state->net in
the netfilter code where it is available and trivially usable.

Pablo, Dave I don't know whose tree this makes more sense to go
through.  I am assuming at least initially Pablos as netfilter is
involved.  From what I have seen there will be a lot of back and forth
between the netfilter code paths and the routing code paths.

The patches are also available (against 4.3-rc1) at:
