Strange, this compiles here. Probably you have to add the following
include to net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_helper.c:

#include <net/net_namespace.h>

I can rebase all my patches on top of fresh tree, fix all conflicts
myself and send you another patchset that will apply to your current
tree.

Please, let me know how to proceed.
