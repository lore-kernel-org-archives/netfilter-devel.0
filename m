pure synproxy can be used on firewall to protect the internal servers,
which don't support neither syncookies and synproxy, from the attack

synproxy with defered connection relay acts as a layer 7 proxy, but
works in kernel space totally, unlike tcp splice tech., which needs
the applications in user space parse the requests, and establish the
connections.
