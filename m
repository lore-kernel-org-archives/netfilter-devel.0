No reason, aside from the math, I think.  Those 48 bytes appear to be 
used for 16 bytes of ip_options plus up to 40 bytes of options data, so 
we're using pretend-space; of which we'd need more to squeeze 
br_input_skb_cb in at the same time.

I hate opening a second can of worms, but, if I read this right, IPCB is 
quite, quite broken.

That's not very helpful.  I could say, with just as much merit, that it 
should be marked deprecated (so that it's not compiled into distribution 
kernels) and you can compile it into yours.

What I dislike is that bridge-netfilter is faulty.
