Ah!!!  I must confess that I didn't make it that far into the code...

OK, that does function.  Hurts my head, though.  ;-)

Encapsulating them so that they appear in the same place might (or migh=
t
not) have gotten the fact that you were not doing a recursive lock
through my head.  Even so, the name "rec_lock" might have overwhelmed
the code structure in my mind.  ;-)

That -is- extreme!  ;-)
