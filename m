This includes many changes in one single shot. This needs to be
splitted in smaller patches that can be reviewed separately, that
makes it easier to others to follow track and spot things.  On top of
that, we should also take the time to make sure what is already in
place is correct, this is a good chance to go over the existing code,
review it and make small changes to accomodate the generic
infrastructure that should follow up.

Now below the more specific comments.

This rcu_head for unattached filters can be avoided, I'll send a
follow up patch for this. After that patch, refcnt and rcu_head can go
out from bpf_prog.

I don't think this is the right moment to add this, but we have to
keep in mind that something similar to this will need to be
accomodated in struct sk_filter at some point to avoid sloppy changes
that may result in reintroducing code later on.

Next step should be to wrap the specific bpf fields in struct
bpf_prog in some clean way IMO, which was partially the aim of this
patch.

Thanks.
