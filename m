I agree with all the points you and Pavel you talked about but I don't 
feel comfortable to have the current process to switch the pid namespace 
because of the process tree hierarchy (what will be the parent of the 
process when you enter the pid namespace for example). What is the 
difference with the sys_bindns or the sys_hijack, proposed a couple of 
years ago ?

I did a suggestion some weeks ago about a new syscall 'cloneat' where 
the child process becomes the child of the targeted process specified in 
the syscall. Maybe it would be interesting to replace the 'setns' by, or 
add, a 'cloneat' syscall with the file descriptor passed as parameter. 
The copy_process function shall not use the nsproxy of the caller but 
the one provided in the fd argument.

The newly created process becomes the child of the process where we 
retrieve the namespace with nsfd and this one have to 'waitpid' it, (the 
caller of 'cloneat' can not wait it). It's a bit similar with the 
CLONE_PARENT flag, except the creation order is inverted (the father 
creates for the child).

So when entering the container, we specify the pid 1 of the container 
which is usually a child reaper.

Does it make sense ?

Thanks
