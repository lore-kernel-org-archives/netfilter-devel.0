To use server-side transparent proxying (i.e. using a foreign address
when sending out packets), only tproxy_core is needed.

You want to be using IPPROTO_TCP here, as I doubt there is a guarantee
that 0 will never choose SCTP.

Const is good:
	static const unsigned int value =3D 1;

Replace last one by
	inet_pton(PF_INET, "192.0.2.37", &name.sin_addr);

(Hacking anything inside sin_addr is, strictly speaking, breaking the
=E2=80=9Cencapsulation=E2=80=9D, as far as that =E2=80=9Cexists=E2=80=9D=
 in C.)

You will need

	bind(fd, (const void *)&name, sizeof(name));

to avoid a compiler warning ;-)

IIRC, you _can_ find out, though I agree it's rather a hack (with=20
tproxy, you can just use the address as received via recvmsg):

	getsockopt(fd, SOL_IP, SO_ORIGINAL_DST, &sockaddr, &sizeptr);
