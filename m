Yes plenty this one is with lockdep

Chain exists of:
  rtnl_mutex --> __ip_vs_mutex --> sk_lock-AF_INET

 Possible unsafe locking scenario:

       CPU0                    CPU1
       ----                    ----
  lock(sk_lock-AF_INET);
                               lock(__ip_vs_mutex);
                               lock(sk_lock-AF_INET);
  lock(rtnl_mutex);

 *** DEADLOCK ***

3 locks held by ipvsadm/993:
 #0:  (genl_mutex){+.+.+.}, at: [<ffffffff812edc52>] genl_lock+0x17/0x19
 #1:  (__ip_vs_mutex){+.+.+.}, at: [<ffffffff81307dcb>] ip_vs_genl_set_cmd+0xe1/0x3a3

Yes.

Yes the socket operations

I think we should avoid global mutexes as a rule of tumb, 
because it's realy hard to keep track of all possible cases 
that can occur when multiple netns is alive and/or goes up and down.

There might be more suprises while a netns exits (in terms of locks)...
my gut feeling is, avoid global locks as long as possible.

OK

I do agree, but in the long term I vote for mutex per netns.
 
Thanks a lot Julian
