Please dont' let this deviate to a flame war.
I just said there are use cases, nothing more, nothing less.

This is software. There are lots of ways to archive the same goal.
Every solution has its pro and cons, its not always black and white.

Nothing, you archive the same in a different way.
However keep in mind that not all computers out there run Linux.

Its quite simple to setup NAT rules, they work with every OS.

On the other hand, balancing by changing MAC address or
IPv6inIPv6 Tunnels can be a headache, getting this going with
Windows, Mac, Solaris and so on.

Issues with DAD and source address selection doesn't make it easier.
Have a look at net/netfilter/ipvs/ip_vs_xmit.c. There is a reason, why
NAT for IPv6 is already in the Kernel since three years.

I fully agree. NAT can not replace your firewall rules.

However with NAT you could get some kind of anonymity.
Think of Tor: If your server/client operates with private IP addresses,
your public IP address is still masked after a security breach.

Also in my opinion the most important reason for NAT.
