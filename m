Sure they do, if they are destined for the host itself. I'm not sure
what's so hard to understand about this patch, you have f.i. multiple
tunnels using the same remote network, on INPUT and POSTROUTING you SNAT
them to seperate networks based on criteria like the network device or
the IPsec tunnel to be able to distinguish them.
