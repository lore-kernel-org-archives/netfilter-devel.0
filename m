OK maybe we can get around this.  So we will postpone the resize
or rehash when a walk is in place, however, when we hit a hard
limit, i.e., when insert would otherwise fail, then we do the
rehash regardless of any outstanding walks.  The walks will just
behave erratically or we could force them to start from scratch
again.
