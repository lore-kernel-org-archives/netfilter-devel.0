I was going to pull from your tree and take it like that, but when I
pulled I got 5 real changes and 50 merges with net-2.6, yikes! :-)

If there was one or two merge changesets in there, I would have
taken it.  But anything more than that for a tree containing
5 bug fixes is excessive.

I'll apply these as patches, but I really do want to be able to
pull from your trees so please try to provide a cleaner tree
next time.

Thanks!
