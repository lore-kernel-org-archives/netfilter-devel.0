Comparing path each time obviously doesn't make sense but you can
determine the cgroup on config and hold onto the pointer while the
rule exists.

Currently, it's tricky because we have multiple hierarchies to
consider and there isn't an efficient way to map from task to cgroup
on a specific hierarchy.  I'm not sure whether we should add another
mapping table in css_set or just allow using path matching on the
unified hierarchy.  The latter should be cleaner and easier but more
restrictive.

Anyways, it isn't manageable in the long term to keep adding
controllers simply to tag tasks differently.  If we want to do this,
let's please work on a way to match a task's cgroup affiliation
efficiently.

Thanks.
