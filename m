In the general case, I agree.

In the one existing case (netfilter), it adds a module that is never
unloaded.  (refcounts are bumped up and down, but I don't see an
auto-reap based on cleared multicast group subscriptions.)  For that
matter, netlink_realloc_groups() isn't reversed on error either.

In the proposed case (audit) it is only a permissions check, so there is
nothing to undo.

So, I was being lazy looking at the existing situation.

Is it time to add a ".unbind = netlink_unbind" to struct proto_ops
netlink_ops?  (I am only half serious here...)

Fair enough.  I'll go back and look at updating subscriptions and
listeners first and undoing those actions if the bind fails.  In the
case of netlink_setsockopt() it is just one to undo, which is easy.
netlink_bind() is a bit more complex, but doable.

The whole purpose here was to add a way for each protocol to be able to
add its own permissions check and signal a way for netlink to refuse the
subscription if the userspace process doesn't have the required
permissions, so not returning an error defeats that whole purpose.
