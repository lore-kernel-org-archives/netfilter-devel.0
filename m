Well, currently, the existing cgroups matches only filter packets that
are sent to an established socket. All other packets are ignored. So
when users install such matches as advertised by the documented
examples, and the chain policy is permissive, the firewall 'leaks'
packets, which is unexpected.

In the code as it stands after my patch set, I don't see where skb->sk
is locked? After all, skb->sk is NULL, even on the 2nd iteration, which
is why I patched the newly looked up socket to be available in the nf hook.

It's what I want to get working, but other 'meta' hooks can be made
working in a similar fashion.

Yes, that's true. The idea for multicast would be to just drop the
cloned skb instead of delivering it to the final socket.

Hmm, I see your point.

Ok, but how would that be different from the unconditional demuxing
patches we've kicked around earlier, especially when it comes to
multicast sockets? Could you explain what you have in mind here?

That would be a new netfilter hook then, something that is called after
LOCAL_IN, for ingress only? In a sense, it would be called from the
protocol handlers, just as my patches do right now, but instead of
conditionally re-iterating the same rules again, we would walk a
different chain?

The idea is simply to have a packet filter which is based on information
derived from the task that sends or will eventually handle the packet.
IOW: We want to be able to install netfilter rules that apply to all
packets received or sent by tasks that match a certain criteria, without
modifying the sources of those tasks.

As we already have net_cls hooked up in netfilter rules, it seems
easiest to just get this working. But with the multiple approaches we
already had, it appears the real fix needs more thinking.


Thanks,
Daniel
