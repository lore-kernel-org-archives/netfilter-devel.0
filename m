I'm starting to like this more and more too, as my code is getting much
smaller ;)

One quick question, though.  Do you have any ideas on how I can make
sure that the user doesn't supply the same name twice (ie. two rules
with the same user_supplied_name)?

The problem is that the userspace always re-adds all the existing rules
before inserting a new one and only later deletes the old rules. :\
