So we attach after starting a VM due to icmpv6_error setting the ct in
some incoming skb to the "untracked" catchall one. Then we panic when I
force a panic if attempting to free the nf_conntrack_untracked static
struct with this backtrace:

#5  0xffffffff81455884 in panic (
    fmt=0xffffffff81ec51e0 "JCM: nf_conntrack_destroy: trying to destroy
nf_conntrack_untracked!\n")
    at kernel/panic.c:73
#6  0xffffffff813d266c in nf_conntrack_destroy (nfct=<value optimized
out>) at net/netfilter/core.c:244

net/core/skbuff.c:402
#9  0xffffffff813abaf9 in skb_release_all (skb=0xffff880223b8b700) at

#11 0xffffffff813abbfe in kfree_skb (skb=0xffff880223b8b700) at
net/core/skbuff.c:456

Could you please add (or recommend for me to test) some logic to catch
attempts to free the nf_conntrack_untracked and prevent it? Also, maybe
in the init_net code you could remove the re-initialization of the
untracked conntrack each time a namespace is created?

Thanks!

Jon.
