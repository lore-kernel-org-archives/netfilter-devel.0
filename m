Well... not exactly, but you are right only the first loop (SET_COUNTER) =
will=20
really do something. The if (cpu =3D=3D curcpu) will be true but the comp=
iler wont=20
  know that, cpu and curcpu are still C variables.

get_counters() is not critical, so I agree with you we can stick the gene=
ral=20
version (not the UP optimized one)

Well, in UP case, the rwlock_t is a nulldef.

I was inspired by another use of percpu data in include/linux/genhd.h
#ifdef  CONFIG_SMP
     struct disk_stats *dkstats;
#else
     struct disk_stats dkstats;
#endif

But if you dislike this, we can use pointer for all cases.
