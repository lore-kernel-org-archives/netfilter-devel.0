No major objetions to this sanity check. Some comment below.

You can split nf_log_register() in two functions to avoid this.

I think you can use pr_fmt to avoid appending log, it's also going to
append useful information to know which logger has indeed failed.

Could you add a goto err1; instead? Just in case we need to extend
this again later on, we'll skip some refactoring.

Thanks.
