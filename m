I'm afraid this extra Kconfig dependency that Arnd adds to fix this is
a symptom that there is something that doesn't belong there.

I overlook this new hook on priority -1, how does this integrate into
our infrastructure?

And mainly, isn't there any better way to integrate this into the
stack?

And why didn't you Cc netfilter-devel for code that involves
Netfilter?

We have to evaluate how this integrates into what we have, if it
breaks when it interacts with other components that we have.

I'm very sorry to say, but none of this has happened so far.
