I'll soon push a patch for all nfnetlink_{conntrack,queue,log} stuff for
net-2.6.14.  Don't worry about that.

But getting back to the original connbytes issue.  Is it worth fixing
it, if the core iptables doesn't even work (the "old bug")?

I don't think that we're ever going to fix that bug in the old
{get,set}sockopt interface, but rather introduce a netlink interface
when pkt_tables matures.
