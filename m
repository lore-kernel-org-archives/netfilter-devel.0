>=20
> In a nutshell:
>=20
> 1. A --track option was added to the SECMARK target, which causes the=20
>    security mark being applied to the packet to also be applied to a new
>    secmark field on the conntrack (only if it is unmarked).
>=20
> 2. A new CONNSECMARK target was added which copies the secmark value to=
=20
>    packets.
>=20
> This allows all packets on a connection (or related to it) to be marked=
=20
> with the same security label, so that they can be explicitly=20
> differentiated.
>=20
> This also turns out to simplify the SELinux policy, while the xtables=20
> implementation has been designed to remain as simple as possible (e.g. it=
=20
> only copies lables to packets, and has no options).
>=20
> So, here's an example of per-packet network policy for vsftpd with the ne=
w=20
> code:
>=20
>   allow ftpd_t ftpd_packet_t:packet { recv send };
>=20
> Assuming it doesn't do DNS lookups, that's it in terms of access control=
=20
> rules for packets.  This covers all established and related packets,=20
> including ICMP and the FTP data connetion.
>=20
> (see the full policy at=20
> http://people.redhat.com/jmorris/selinux/secmark/policy/ftpd_tracked/ftpd=
_tracked.te)
>=20
> In terms of iptables rules, the only real change is that we need to add=
=20
> CONNSECMARK rules for all incoming and outgoing packets (assuming you wan=
t=20
> this for all services, otherwise, use iptables selectors to apply=20
> CONNSECMARK on a per-service basis).  Here's an example for the above:
>=20
> #
> # Accept incoming connections, label SYN packets, and copy
> # labels to connections.
> #
> $IPT -A SEL_INPUT -p tcp --dport 21 -m state --state NEW -j SEL_FTPD
> $IPT -A SEL_FTPD -j SECMARK --selctx system_u:object_r:ftpd_packet_t:s0 -=
-track
> $IPT -A SEL_FTPD -j ACCEPT

This all looks very nice - Thank You!
Just one question: does the code canonicalize the security label? It
would be nice if the same rules could be used on MLS and non-MLS
systems.
