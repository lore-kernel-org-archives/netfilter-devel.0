I'm happy to do so, but note that that breaks the custom of
having one static struct xt_$NAME for each file xt_$NAME.[ch].

It may be reasonable, as the same issue may keep popping up
as additional sk_buff fields are found useful for filtering. For
instance, skb->queue_mapping could be used in conjuction with
network flow classification (ethtool -N). All the ancillary data
accessible from BPF likely has some use and could be ported
to iptables (rxhash, pkt_type, ...).

To avoid rule explosion, I considered an xt_skbuff match rule that
applies the same mask operation, range and inversion tests, and
takes a field id to select the sk_buff field to operate on. I think
the BPF patch is a better long term solution.
