Not a very good pull request, I don't know how you were able to
successfully create it with all the inaccuracies.

The dst.c change wasn't mentioned.

and the last three patches (the error propagation fixes from Patrick)
weren't even in this tree.

I pulled, but I cannot believe that GIT didn't complain about this
or provide some kind of feedback indicating that what you're asking
me to pull doesn't match up with what's actually in that tree.

I mean, if anyone had sent you a pull request like this, you would
have rejected it.
