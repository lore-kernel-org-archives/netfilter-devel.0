By the way, i had also problem with frto with local connections, and it=
 was=20
trivial to reproduce. But because of proprioetary(but i have sources)=20
userspace application and specific way of using it - i didn't report to=
=20
maillist. But after patch is ready, add me please in cc, i will test it=
 with=20
me too.

=46or me disabling frto helps to solve problem. With frto i have=20
connections "stalling", if there is trasferred large chunks of data ove=
r=20
loopback. It is complicated way how it works all - but i can try to exp=
lain=20
how everything works, if required.
