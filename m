Hi Corentin,

Historically, there were plenty of more copyright notices for certain
drivers or sections of the code being printed while booting.  I still
remember fondly the many ethernet driver notices of a Donald Becker, for
example.

I understand that it is questionable whether or not such statements are
"useful".  You might argue, their use is in
* stating a legal formality to the user
* making it simpler to determine if a given part of code is used in a
  given device (e.g. as part of GPL enforcement) while just logging the
  serial console and no requirement to (find a way to) dump the internal
  flash

Besides such practical arguments (it is of what use to whom), there are
legal concerns regarding the removal of copyright statements.  This
holds true on whether or not it is Free Software, or whether or not it
is GPL licensed.  If an author puts a copyright statement somehwere, he
exercises his right to be regarded as the author of the work.  It is
typically not permitted to remove such notices, as that would be a
copyright infringement in itself.

Also, beyond general legal concerns, the GPLv2 states explicitly:

Now you can argue whether the kernel is a an interactive program, but at
least you can see some intent to not remove any notices/messages that
were originally present in the program.

So I think your patch could only applied if the respective copyright
holders agree to remove their respective notices.

I personally would argue to keep them.  Nobody has complained about them
so far, and they have probably saved many weeks of my work time in GPL
compliance / enforcement work.  I understand this is a "niche use case",
though ;)
