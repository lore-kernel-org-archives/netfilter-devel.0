What I am thinking is:

"ip ns <name> route add blah" is:
fd = open("/var/run/netns/<name>");
sys_setns(fd);  /* Like unshare but takes an existing namespace */
/* Then the rest of the existing ip command */

"ip ns list" is:
dfd = open("/var/run/netns", O_DIRECTORY);
getdents(dfd, buf, count);

"ip ns new <name>" is:
unshare(CLONE_NEWNS);
fd = nsfd(NETNS);
mkdir("/var/run/netns/<name>");
mount("none", "/var/run/netns/<name>", "ns", 0, fd);

Using unix domain names means that which namespaces you see is under
control of userspace.  Which allows for nested containers (something I
use today), and ultimately container migration.

Using genetlink userspace doesn't result in a nestable implementation
unless I introduce yet another namespace, ugh.
