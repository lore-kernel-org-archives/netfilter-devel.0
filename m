No it does not.  The start call roughly corresponds to the start
call in seq_file which does not span across reads.

Note that this is not the final solution but just the first step.
So right now it does not prevent/postpone resizes completely.  It's
only meant to be a strict improvement over what we currently have.

So indeed resizes will be stopped within a single read but not
across reads for seq_file.  Similarly for netlink dump resizes
will only be stopped for a single skb.

I will do the rest of what we discussed once I implement rehashing
since there will be dependencies on it.

This is intentional, it is what udp_diag does.  We'll have to do
this if you ever want to convert UDP sockets over to rhashtable
so we might as well do it now.

If you don't hold the bucket lock then anyone that recycles objects
like UDP will end up walking into the ether.

As before this is not held across reads but only within a read.
Please see patch #2.

Cheers,
