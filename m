Ok. I hope it will still reproduce with tcpdump running... Btw, doing cat 
/proc/net/tcp during the stall wouldn't be a bad idea (in addition to 
tcpdumping it). Also please let the tcpdumps run long enough if the stall 
persists, something like 15mins doesn't hurt because there are large 
timer values possibly involved.

You might have mentioned it but I would like you to confirm which kernel 
version the server is running (at least 2.6.25.7 or 2.6.26 is new enough 
to have all bug fixes)?

I sort of assumed so, thanks for the confirmation.

It definately wouldn't hurt (though I usually can figure out what happens 
in the other end) and I guess it's quite easy for you to arrange.

In case there's some other use than your testing traffic with the server, 
it's probably polite to filter there aggressively enough to not get that 
much unrelated traffic (tcpdump ... host <ip> and host <clientip> and port 
<portnum>, or so, I guess the ip address pair should be the vpn endpoints 
since the nntp traffic seems to go through it and the portnum is 119, if 
unsure you can verify with sudo netstat -p which tcp connections are 
associated to fetchnews if that's not immediately obvious).
