Another solution which might be more clear is to make
conn_schedule() fragment aware then the "&& !iph.fragoffs"
check can be removed.

 PACKET_TO_BIG needs to be sent at least

making conn_schedule() fragment aware will solve it.

Yes that's right
if you enable conntrack there is an ugly way to solve it.

I'll do some more tests with only skb->mark copied.
=46or some reason "ipvs" fragments went into the FORWARD chain=20
instead of INPUT i.e. if there is an input route ip6_rcv_finish()=20
doesn't try to route it.

	if (skb_dst(skb) =3D=3D NULL)
		ip6_route_input(skb);

OK, I can rename it
