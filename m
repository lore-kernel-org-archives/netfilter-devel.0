I am afraid it is, see below for example

Since 8405a8fff3f8545c888a872d6e3c0c8eecd4d348 any call to
nf_unregister_hook invokes nf_queue_nf_hook_drop().

If the nfnetlink_queue module is loaded, that means we call
nfqnl_nf_hook_drop function via the nf_queue nf_queue_handler struct
in nf_queue.c .

And since nfqnl_nf_hook_drop() uses net_generic() ...

... we cannot count on this.

Example:
1. we try to create new netns
2. net_namespace.c:ops_init walks the netns op list and calls ->init()
3. some of these init hooks register netfilter hooks
4. we call init hook for nfnetlink_queue, but this yields -EFOO (alternatively, another ->init handler before this failed)
5. netns init code invokes the ->exit() handlers in reverse order for unwinding
6. hooks get unregistered, which makes a call into nf_queue_nf_hook_drop
7. nf_queue then calls q->nfqnl_nf_hook_drop(net)
8. oops as nfnetlink_queue wasn't setup in this net ns and net_generic
returns some undefined result

AFAICS no other callers do something similar, but yes,
we'd need this all over the place if there are others.

Maybe we need a saner fix, e.g. by adding bounds check to net_generic(),
and making sure that net_generic() returns non-NULL only if the per
netns memory was allocated properly.
