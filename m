	Yes, as long as we do not reach the protocol
receiving handlers, eg. tcp_v4_rcv. But the problem is 
that many modules can use this CB part but nobody knows
if it is valid - it is not reset.

	If data is part of IP6CB it is reset in ipv6_rcv
with memset(IP6CB(skb), 0, sizeof(struct inet6_skb_parm));

	One option is to extend this memset to cover this
new IP6CB_EXTHDR part if CONFIG_NF_DEFRAG_IPV6 is defined.
I.e. we can create new struct inet6_skb_parm_exthdr, DCCP, TCP
will continue to use/extend inet6_skb_parm but
ipv6_find_hdr_cb will know that their part is reset. Then
above memset can become:

memset(IP6CB_EXTHDR(skb), 0, sizeof(struct inet6_skb_parm_exthdr));

struct inet6_skb_parm_exthdr {
	struct inet6_skb_parm	h6;
#if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_NF_DEFRAG_IPV6)
	__u16	thoff; ...
	...
#endif
};

	Not sure if it should depend only on
CONFIG_NF_DEFRAG_IPV6.
