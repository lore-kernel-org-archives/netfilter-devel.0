But we are discussing netfilter and (de)fragmentation: what should happen 
when the packet reassembly in netfilter times out and the destination is 
the host itself.

In IPv4 the very first subsystem is ipv4_conntrack_defrag, called from 
NF_INET_PRE_ROUTING. Then comes the raw table and after that conntrack.

In IPv6 the very first is the raw table, then comes ipv6_defrag and then 
conntrack.

Why the order of the raw table and defragmentation is reversed for IPv6?

That makes impossible to use the NOTRACK target in IPv6: for example if 
someone enters

ip6tables -t raw -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j NOTRACK

and if we receive fragmented packets then the first fragment will be 
untracked and thus skip nf_ct_frag6_gather (and conntrack), while all 
subsequent fragments enter nf_ct_frag6_gather and reassembly will never 
successfully be finished.

IMHO this is a bug and should be fixed. Patrick, please consider applying 
the patch below.
