what are the userspace level tools that I am supposed to use in place of 
my current process? (which is to have a script that 1. stops traffic, 2. 
executes the iptables commands to create the rules that I want, then 3. 
enables traffic)

iptables-restore only works if you are actually restoring the old set of 
rules. if you need to change the rules that doesn't work.
