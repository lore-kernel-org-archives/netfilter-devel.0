Ok, finally figured out the difference. Looks like depending
on the sendto() / local route / forward route / my patched mrt
the skb that gets passed to ipgre_tunnel_xmit() seems to have
nfctinfo either 0 or 2. This value is not modified; nf_reset()
is called just before ip_local_out(). Looks like nf_reset()
clears nfct to NULL, but does not touch nfctinfo.

So when LOCAL_OUT hook for the GRE packet is hit, depending
where the packet came: it has nfct=3DNULL and nfctinfo=3DESTABLISHED
or NEW. This also seems to affect if that specific skb gets
the nat/OUTPUT hook called.

Is this behaviour for nf_reset() intentional?
