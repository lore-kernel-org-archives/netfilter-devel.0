That is why this is a dependent read barrier. Some architectures (e.g.
Alpha) *do* allow dependent reads to be observed out of order, so you can
effectively load the data pointed to by a pointer before you load the
pointer itself!

Take a look at Paul's paper about memory ordering if you're curious:

The smp_* barriers expand to barrier() when !CONFIG_SMP, which gives you the
memory clobber you want.

What I'm *not* 100% sure about is the table freeing path. There is a mutex
there for removing the table from a list, but I'm not sure how we ensure
that there are no parallel readers at that point.
