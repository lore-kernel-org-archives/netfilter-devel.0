	It has been five days since I disable high resolution timer and
have not got any problems anymore.

	Well, as far as I know, high res timer related, what changed
in 2.6.25 is the following:

http://git.kernel.org/?p=3Dlinux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=3D=
commit;h=3D8f4d37ec073c17e2d4aa8851df5837d798606d6f

	(although if I disable dynticks, the problem persists)

	Although in 2.6.24 we already had, for example the x86-32/64
arch reunification and I don't know if it has anything to do with my
problem in 2.6.25... just some thoughts... I wrote that because the
problem doesn't happen in 32 bit machines, but only in x86_64...

	Of course I'm not saying for sure that the high res timer is
causing this. Maybe, as you said before, the problem is much more
complex and realy don't know what in fact uses high res timer.

	Anyway, I'll leave high res timer disabled for now until we
discover something new.
