Yes, this has always annoyed me too as it doesn't really work for me
in a similar setup where traffic first goes through an IPsec tunnel,
then through a MSS mangling gateway and then over a DSL line. I'll
add a patch on top of yours to take the MSS in reverse direction
into account.

No, this is obviously a good idea, I actually thought we'd already
prevent increasing it in all cases. I've applied your patch, thanks.
