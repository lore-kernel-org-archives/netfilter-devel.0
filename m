	Notes only about PATCH 3/6:

- I was worried that throttle was used during cleanup
with the idea to stop traffic. But as now it is only an
optimization to avoid traffic to spend cycles in IPVS
code I'll suggest to use it without atomic operations.
It is not fatal if some packet does not see the disabling
immediately. So, may be using 'if (net_ipvs(net)->enable)'
is enough.

As result, there is no need to disable traffic in
__ip_vs_dev_cleanup, it is going to stop during
_device cleanup anyways.

- Please move check for 'enable' in ip_vs_in() before
ip_vs_fill_iphdr, this is the preferred place:

+	net = skb_net(skb);
+	if (!net_ipvs(net)->enable)
+		return NF_ACCEPT;
	ip_vs_fill_iphdr(af, skb_network_header(skb), &iph);

Note that only ip_vs_in, ip_vs_out and ip_vs_forward_icmp*
need check for 'enable'. Then we can remove them from
ip_vs_in_icmp*

- As device can change its name space it was mandatory we
to add support for NETDEV_UNREGISTER. As we are using
_subsys pernet operations I expect we to see NETDEV_UNREGISTER
while the _device pernet methods are called, so before
our _subsys cleanup.

We can see in log that ip_vs_dst_event() is called before
ip_vs_service_net_cleanup, i.e. before our subsys cleanup.
net/core/dev.c uses register_pernet_device(&default_device_ops)
to call NETDEV_UNREGISTER* during _device cleanup and
to move devices to init_net. So, it should be safe
to rely on NETDEV_UNREGISTER event while we are subsys.

- __ip_vs_service_cleanup needs to call ip_vs_flush after
converting to ip_vs_unlink_service_nolock.

- For ip_vs_dst_event: I prefer to put everything in this
function, the ip_vs_svc_reset is not needed (name is not
good too). For example:

	struct ip_vs_dest *dest;
	unsigned int hash;

	mutex_lock(&__ip_vs_mutex);
	/* No need to use rs_lock, the mutex protects the list */
	for (hash = 0; hash < IP_VS_RTAB_SIZE; hash++) {
		list_for_each_entry(dest, &ipvs->rs_table[hash], d_list) {
			__ip_vs_dev_reset(dest, dev);
		}
	}

	/* The mutex protects the trash list */
	list_for_each_entry(dest, &ipvs->dest_trash, n_list) {
		__ip_vs_dev_reset(dest, dev);
	}

	mutex_unlock(&__ip_vs_mutex);

	No need to use __ip_vs_svc_lock or rs_lock because we
do not change the lists, __ip_vs_dev_reset has the needed
dst_cache locking (dst_lock). I assume we can safely use our
__ip_vs_mutex from netdevice notifier.
