Hi Dave,

following are three netfilter fixes for net-next, fixing:

- the NAT issue reported by Stephen, which was caused by inverted logic
  in NF_HOOK_COND(), causing it to skip the POST_ROUTING hook invocation

- an assertion in ct_extend, caused by invalid ordering in ctnetlink
  when setting up new conntracks. Additionally it is invalid to
  attach helpers to existing conntracks, which is disabled by this
  patch.

- an skb leak in nf_queue when userspace returns NF_STOLEN as verdict

Please apply or pull from:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kaber/nf-next-2.6.git master

Thanks!
