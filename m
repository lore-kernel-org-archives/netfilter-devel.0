Nice series. If you route them through net-next, please add:

Acked-by: Pablo Neira Ayuso <pablo@netfilter.org>

or I can place them in nf-next, your call.

Regarding Jiri's okfn() signature changes, please let me know on those
patches, they will simplify a patchset I'll submit soon. And count on
me to help on that change too, of course.

Thanks a lot David!
