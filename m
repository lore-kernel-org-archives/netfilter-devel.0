just adding/removing.. beside huge efforts in the previous version in
copying/cloning this seems not to be bad effort..

i didn't change any function prototype at the user space, so i think
nothing is break (only the functions implementations at libiptc.c are
changed).. just between kernel and user (this is internal).. and just
for entries structure..
netlink is one of my ideas about this version and may implement..

by this new idea, many things are changed and wrirten from scratch.. i
can continue its implementation to be completed.

beside your new ideas about nftables, this implementation also has
some new ideas:
about sets in  nftables: we can implement sets as classifier in this version
about registers in nftables: we can see matches as registers in this version
and about multiple targets: this version can use multiple targets..

not only user to kernel.. this limited to add/remove..
using classifiers as search engine, common framework for tables and
new semantics.. so on..
