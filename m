First of all, thanks for your performance analysis and patches.  I'm
very inclined of merging them.

This only describes your "compare_if_lstrings()" changes, and I'm happy
to merge them.

However, you also removed the use of the FWINV macro and replaced it by
explicit code (including the bool1/bool2 variables, which are not really
named intuitively).  Why was this neccessary?
