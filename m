Regarding your suggestion to apply changes more incrementally, I think
that's a good idea since that will help us evaluate if there are
better things we can do to improve that code.

So please go send small batches with incremental way that we can
review.  Depending on the change, some of them may trigger the rework
of existing code, others probably will just get in as is.

Thanks.
