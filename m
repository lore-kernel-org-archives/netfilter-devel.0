iptables works in whole tables. Userspace submits a table, checkentry is 
called for all rules in the new table, things are swapped, then destroy 
is called for all rules in the old table. By that logic (which existed
since dawn I think), only the swap operation needs to be locked.

The fact that `iptables -A` is called a hundred times means you are 
doing 100 table replacements -- instead of one. And calling
synchronize_net at least a 100 times.

As I read the new code, it seems that synchronize_net is only
used on copying the rules from kernel into userspace;
not when updating them from userspace:

IPT_SO_GET_ENTRIES -> get_entries -> copy_entries_to_user -> 
alloc_counters -> synchronize_net.

Would a seqlock suffice, as it does for the 64-bit jiffies?
