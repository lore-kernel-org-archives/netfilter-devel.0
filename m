This seems correct to me, some side comments.

While at this, I think it would be good to fix comment style to:

        /* We have ...
         * ...
         */

I can fix this here, no need to resend, just let me know.

Not directly related to your patch, but I don't find a good reason why
we're accepting this packet.

If the conntrack from the unconfirmed list is dying, then the object
will be released by when the packet leaves the stack to its
destination. With stateful filtering depending in place, the follow up
packet in the reply direction will likely be considered invalid (if
tcp tracking is on). Fortunately for us, the origin will likely
retransmit the syn again, so the ct will be setup accordingly.

So, why should we allow this to go through?

This return verdict was introduced in: fc35077 ("netfilter:
nf_conntrack: fix a race in __nf_conntrack_confirm against
nf_ct_get_next_corpse()") btw.
