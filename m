The latest patch works quite good. I accidentally had your
previous patch applied, too, which gave even better results.
Though I don't know enough about the gory details of FRTO
if this effectivly disables it...

Here are two fresh tcpdumps, one with the last patch only
and one which also includes your previous patch:

LOL, this reminds me about the post on kernel.org from 2007-03-01:
"Kudos ... to Hewlett Packard for building a machine that can take the =

of an unnamed shipping company and keep on ticking".=20

Just think of "unnamed" while looking at the images of the broken serve=
r ;-)

Have a nice weekend,
