Even so, saving the hash of the reply tuple isn't a good idea.

If NAT is turned on, the current code is:

mangle the reply tuple -> compute the hash of the reply tuple ->
insert into the conntrack hash table.

the new code is

compute the hash of the reply tuple -> mangle the reply tuple ->
recompute the hash of the reply tuple -> insert into the conntrack
hash table.

As you see, the hash computing is done twice, and we use more CPU
cycles than before.
