yes, but it happens to happen more often, thus I see it as a bug.

Yes, since it now looks to the routing code as if you wanted to find out
a source ip for locally-originated packets.

Question is: can we do this?  Can we ask the routing code to choose a
source address while we already specify one?  I don't think so.

Ok, I think I agree with you. It sounds like the right thing to do,
rather than trying to fix a broken configuration within MASQUERADE.
