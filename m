To quote that bug:

I stumbled upon this problem in debian bug #541658[1] ("[iceweasel] cannot open 
research.microsoft.com" - only worth reading for entertainment purposes) and,
after that bug was closed, analysed it in my blog[2] until a friend of mine
found out why the page loads when clamping mss to pmtu is disabled or
restricted to a range (like with "iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags
SYN,RST SYN -m tcpmss --mss 1400:1536 -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu") but
doesn't load with "simple" clamping. His really great and detailed analysation
of the problem may be seen at [3].

If I read/understand that correctly, clamping to 1400 worked - there was
no need to clamp all the way down to 536.
