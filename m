Ack.

Yes, I decided to make this in different steps.  I'll be submitting a
new patch with the u32 (and the binary operators support) pretty soon.

Yes, I made this patch on top of the one you have sent earlier for
upstream inclusion.  There were some comments from Patrick to that one
and, as I said in my email yesterday, I'll rebase the target patches
once the original one is included upstream.

Do you want me to take a look at Patrick's comments and resubmit the
patch you've sent with the changes Patrick asked for?

I'll change the revision to 2 as well.

Thanks for your review and help on this!
