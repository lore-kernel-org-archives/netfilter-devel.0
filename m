Apparently it does not matter.

The real problem seems to be bug that did not account for
irq times properly. It was fixed by "sched: account system time
properly" f5f293a4e3d0a0c52cec31de6762c95050156516 and that
caused biased CPU usage measurements.

Testing with kernel having that, I'm getting the same CPU
readings. And oprofile in timer mode didn't help noticing this.

Sorry for the noise.
