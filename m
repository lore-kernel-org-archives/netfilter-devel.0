The container support for netfilter seems to be in intermediate state,
we need several patches to get it finished that:

* subsys_table definition in nfnetlink.c.
* ctnl_notifier and ctnl_notifier_exp definitions in
  nfnetlink_conntrack.c
* similar things for nfnetlink_queue and nfnetlink_log.

If nobody is going to fix all these, I'll find some spare time to do
it myself, but I don't think we'll have a proper fix that we can pass
to -stable. This will have to go to net-next, given the amount of
patches that we'll need to appropriately fix this.

As said, I'm not sure that this can happen, given that the amount of
patches that we need to fix it fine, sorry.
