Good point.  I thought we added this because Bandan Das wanted
options.  But rereading the thread in question

	http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/9/3/16

it seems that he doesn't actually need options.  So what happened
appears to be a misunderstanding.  Bandan tried to improve my
original memset hack by compiling options which would have been
fine except that his approach ended up mangling the packet which
is a big no-no.

So the most straightforward solution is to go back to my original
hack and just do a straight memset zero of the cb area before
each entry into the IP stack from the bridge.

I'll try to create a patch that essentially reverts the patch
that led us here.

Cheers,
