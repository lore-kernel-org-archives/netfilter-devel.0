This one also mangles the text, so I cannot follow the race you are
describing.  I'll try to reconstruct...

Have you run into this problem in practice, or is this based on a
theory?

Yes, I think you are correct.  There is a race.  As we are modifying
the ct->status, without holding the hash bucket lock.

Guess that would be one approach.

Perhaps we could get rid of unconfirmed list handling in get_next_corpse?
