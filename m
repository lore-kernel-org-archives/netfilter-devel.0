Hi Pablo,

this is a revision of a previous pull request.
The previous pull request contained one fix-all patch.
As per your request it has been split into a number of separate patches.
This request also includes several new patches that fix
yet more problems flagged by static analysis.

Separately, I have also posted the following SCTP patch
"[PATCH] sctp: Correct type and usage of sctp_end_cksum()"

With this series and the above patch applied I
believe that IPVS is now sparse-clean.

Much thanks to Julian Anastasov for his patience, and
Dan Carpenter and Hans Schillstrom for their help.

The following changes since commit 3e3251b3f289528732edab386ddf73ac428359b7:

  net: sctp: minor: remove dead code from sctp_packet (2013-04-22 16:25:21 -0400)

  ipvs: Use network byte order for sync message size (2013-04-23 11:43:06 +0900)

----------------------------------------------------------------
IPVS fixes for v3.10

This series fixes a number of problems which were flagged by
static analysis.

The first two patches in the series resolve problems that
have been introduced since v3.9.

* ipvs: fix sparse warnings for ip_vs_conn listing
* ipvs: properly dereference dest_dst in ip_vs_forget_dev

The remaining patches resolve problems that have been around for longer.

It is not obvious to me that any of the problems resolved by
these patches manifest as bugs.
