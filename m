No problems.  Here is a new version of these two patches which
hopefully should work on netfilter as well.

Note that the major functional difference compared to the previous
one is that resizes are now handled properly and will cause the
iterator to restart from scratch.

However, as with all existing hash table walker implementations,
if you remove an element from the chain that we're walking over
while we're waiting for user-space to give us a new buffer, then
the walk may miss elements that are still on that chain.

Thanks,
