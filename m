It is an either-or choice. You cant have both. The _evil genius_ part i
think is that distros which ship with iptables rules and conntracking
on are going to not even turn on tc and my scripts now have to go
unload one.
But even if the scripts worked (perhaps there are plans to make sure
all scripts continue to work transparently), i care about performance
and  youve suddenly taken that away from me.

So i would agree with adding the two hooks. Priority should be given
to tc in the code path.
