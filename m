OK, this is the patch I'll send upstream.

    netfilter: nf_conntrack_tcp: fix endless loop
    
    When a conntrack entry is destroyed in process context and destruction
    is interrupted by packet processing and the packet is an attempt to
    reopen a closed connection, TCP conntrack tries to kill the old entry
    itself and returns NF_REPEAT to pass the packet through the hook
    again. This may lead to an endless loop: TCP conntrack repeatedly
    finds the old entry, but can not kill it itself since destruction
    is already in progress, but destruction in process context can not
    complete since TCP conntrack is keeping the CPU busy.
    
    Drop the packet in TCP conntrack if we can't kill the connection
    ourselves to avoid this.
