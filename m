That is pretty much my point.  Provide a personal firewall mechanism 
with a well defined API that LSMs can call as necessary.  The personal 
firewall code then notifies a userspace agent over another well defined 
API (netfilter, etc.) and waits for a verdict response.

I've mentioned this approach several times now (perhaps poorly?), if 
there is something you don't understand in my suggestion please let me 
know.  I'm also getting sick of typing "personal firewall" all the 
time, we need a shorter name and I'm going to start calling 
it "pfwall" :)

Why?  You don't need to "register" with the LSM and you don't need 
to "register" with userspace.

Personal preference I suppose, although I am very confident that the 
option described above (LSM calling the pfwall) has a much better 
chance of acceptance that an option which involves hooking the core 
network stack.

Explain what you mean by "dynamically" and give an example.

As I mentioned before in the previous thread, please list and explain 
all your requirements and we can work to arrive at a solution which 
meets those needs.  When possible we should work to develop solutions 
which are as flexible as possible, but flexibility for the sake of 
flexibility often results in unnecessary complexity which is rarely a 
good thing.
