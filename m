There aren't too many existing pr_<level> calls so
that this couldn't be considered.

Files with pr_<level> without pr_fmt:

$ grep -rPl --include=*.[ch] \
	"\bpr_(info|warning|err|alert|notice|crit)\b" * |
  xargs grep -Lw "pr_fmt" | wc -l
569

Uses of pr_<level> without pr_fmt:

$ grep -rPl --include=*.[ch] \
	"\bpr_(info|warning|err|alert|notice|crit)\b" * |
  xargs grep -Lw "pr_fmt" |
  xargs grep -P "\bpr_(info|warning|err|alert|notice|crit)\b" |
  wc -l
2885

If you look at the pr_<levels>, it's nearly
a mechanical thing to strip the ones with
some sort of prefix and add a #define pr_fmt
to replace them.  Most all of them without
prefixes might benefit by using a standardized
#define pr_fmt(etc...) in kernel.h, so the
actual count of changes isn't that high.

Of course printks could not change, there are way too
many of those to consider doing that globally.

But the printks emitted by pr_<level> might change.
Maybe by setting a bit in the string "<level>" or by
some other mechanism.

The removal of KBUILD_MODNAME could only be done
for builds with CONFIG_KALLSYMS or
CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG.

It might also be possible to use something like
CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG to control which modules get
MODNAME, __func__, __LINE__ or offset emitted
by the pr_<level> via some boot/module/sysconf
or FTRACE like parameters.
