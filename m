	Interesting.

	Hmmm. I'll try to report this to the dovecot and inn lists.

	Yes, exactly! I think the same.

	Yes. nmap -sS always solves the problem. Very strange. nmap -sS
for me is kind of brute force attempt to restablish the normal

	Anyway, I disabled htb and frto and everything is fine for now.
I'll keep investigating this.

	I use dovecot por mail. I'll post on the dovecot list. If it's
an userspace issue, better.

	Ok. If I had more useful information, I'll reply.

	Thank you very much!
