I see, that call path is correct, BUT I was talking about another call
path of ip_vs_nat_icmp_v6(), via handle_response_icmp() (which also
calls skb_make_writable).  That call path is triggered, if the
real-server, have shutdown its service and send back an ICMPv6 packet.

Hmm, testing it again, I cannot trigger this issue.  Perhaps I was
confusing my self and were using my test script that added IPv6 exthdrs
to the packet.  Adding print statements to the code, also show the
correct offset now.
I'm dropping this patch-4, and I'll adjust/fix patch-5 ("ipvs: fix
faulty IPv6 extension header handling in IPVS") accordingly.  And I'll
double check patch-5, that exthdr have been accounted for (in the offset
used by skb_make_writable() before calling ip_vs_nat_icmp_v6()).

Is this comment for the API patch-7 ("ipvs: API change to avoid rescan
of IPv6 exthdr") ?
The API patch is going to save 19 calls to ipv6_find_hdr ().

It would be a lot easier for me, if you commented directly on the
patches.

I can see that 'offs_ciph = ciph.len;' is set earlier in this patch, but
that value is primarily used by IP_VS_DBG_PKT.  And offs_ciph, needs to
be updated, again, with the value of ciph.len after the call to
ipv6_find_hdr().  So, yes you are right ;-)

I'll rename offs_ciph to "writable" to emphasize what we are using this
value for.

The port logic was kept.  But I'll make it more clear whats happening,
and keep the "+=" coding style.

As we don't use the flag, after this point, we can just give
ipv6_find_hdr() a NULL value instead.

But I must give you, that it's a little confusing the way we reuse the
ipvsh variable (in ip_vs_out_icmp_v6()).  Think, this needs to be
rewritten to use a separate variable, like in ip_vs_in_icmp_v6().

Yes, as mentioned earlier, I'll fix up patch-5 and remove the
skb_make_writable call.

Yes, its unrelated, lets fix that in another patchset.

I'll hopefully soon have a patchset ready with these changes/updates...
