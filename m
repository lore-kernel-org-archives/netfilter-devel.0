Yeah, a constant one is expected. During the stall it was growing sharply.

Thanks (though I hoped the other way around :-)).

Sure. Whatever of them you feel is the best choice but I doubt there's 
much benefit from doing that for many at the same time. Once we find out 
what is happening for one, the others are the same.

ftp is problematic to tcpdump. Nntp should be fine I guess.

I'm fine with either way. Basically we just want to find out where server 
processes are waiting when the stall happens. If at least one of them was 
in accept() but never made progress it's related to wakeup somehow, if not 
in accept, well, lets reconsider then...

It is interesting, yes... but do you have some idea how that would help
to solve the problem (I don't)? Only thing that I could think of is that 
it could related to setsockopt()s they set differently.
