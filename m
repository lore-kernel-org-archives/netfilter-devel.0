It is in patch 5/5, ovs_ct_find_existing(). The intent it to locate an existing conntrack entry without modifying it, if such an entry exists. This is needed in a case where we first go through the conntrack (calling nf_conntrack_in), then recirculate (to match on the state bits), but do not find a matching flow entry in the flow table. In this case we issue an upcall and let the OVS userspace compute a new flow entry. When the packet gets back to kernel we have lost the skb (as we do not buffer it in the kernel after issuing the upcall). ovs_ct_find_existing() can then be used to populate the nfct and nfctinfo fields of the new skb, as if this skb had gone through the nf_conntrack_in() call. This allows us to pass the packet through NAT after such an upcall without passing the packet thro
 ugh nf_conntrack_in() twice.

ovs_ct_find_existing() is intended to be used only when we have evidence in the OVS flow key that the packet actually went through nf_conntrack_in() prior to the upcall. In the current version of the patches I do not have a test case for this, and I intend to separate out this change into a separate patch before the NAT patch for the next (non-RFC) version.

I could implement ovs_ct_find_existing() using exported conntrack APIs apart from this mapping from conntrack status to enum ip_conntrack_info. ovs_ct_find_existing() is in no way OVS specific, though, so it could be added to the conntrack proper as well, if so desired.
