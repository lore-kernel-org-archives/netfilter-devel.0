Not really, we do read one out of bound byte David.

length = 1;
...
while (length > 0) {
	int opcode = *ptr++; // Note that length is still 1
        switch (opcode) {
        ...
        default:
            opsize = *ptr++; // Note that length is still 1


        ...
        length -= opsize;
}

So we do read 2 bytes, while length was 1.

opsize definitely can read garbage.
Call it padding or redzone or whatever ;)
