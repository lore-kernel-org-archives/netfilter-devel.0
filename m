There is several issues with your submission.  I'll take care of
resubmitting a patch in your name (so you will get credit in the git
log).

If you care to know, issues are:
 1. you are not sending to the appropriate mailing lists,
 2. patch is as an attachment (should be inlined),
 3. the patch have style and white-space issues.

In the resubmit. I'll take a slightly more conservative approach, by
keeping the DYING check under the hash-lock, as it is currently.  I
guess we could do it without holding the hash-lock, but I want to keep
the fix as simple as possible.

Notice the set_bit() is atomic, so we don't have these issues (of bits
getting overridden).
