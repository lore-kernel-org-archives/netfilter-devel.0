Making NF_CONNTRACK_IPV4 default to "m" would select NF_CONNTRACK to "m" if 
it hasn't been selected by the user to be "y", which seems reasonable.

I was also planning to submit another patch to make all netfilter 
childoptions options default to their parent, i.e: NF_CONNTRACK_FTP would 
default NF_CONNTRACK.  This could be one big Kconfig time-saver.

I think that wouldn't be advisable, as this would add an unnecessary 
dependency.  But of course,  it's your call...


Thanks!
