Hello.

Considering only LSM, socket_post_accept()/socket_post_recv_datagram() hooks are
not complicated at all.
A socket may be mapped to multiple processes, but at the moment of picking up
(i.e. accept()/recvmsg()), I think it is accurate 1:1 mapping.
I'm more interested in "Who picks this connection/datagram up?" than
"Which socket enqueues this connection/datagram?"
It may be indifferent for netfilter, but it is region of interest for me.

Oh, I found him at http://nfws.inl.fr/en/?p=50 . (Sorry, I didn't know.)
He is the person who was discussing with me a few days ago.

Right. Thus, I'm proposing LSM hooks at accept()/recvmsg() time.

Regards.
