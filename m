I expect zap_pid_ns_processes should also arrange so we cannot allocate any
more processes.  We certainly need to do something explicit or pid 1 won't
be allocated.  It might make sense to resurrect a pid namespace after it's
death but it is definitely weird.

My original thinking was that the fd's would come from the caller of sys_cloneat....

I will see about reposting sometime soon.

Not bad suggestions.

I am going to explore a bit more.  Given that nsfd is using the same
permission checks as a proc file, I think I can just make it a proc
file.  Something like "/proc/<pid>/ns/net".  With a little luck that
won't suck too badly.

Not really.  The assumption was that there would be a very similar
file descriptor that we could use with poll.
