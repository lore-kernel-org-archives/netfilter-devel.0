I truely hope it will be since I'm working (slowly, as time permits)
on the *tables successor that will implement things like this in
userspace. Every module we add that adds more complicated logic in
the kernel will make adding an iptables compat layer harder.

I'd CC the netfilter user list, its likely you'll find some voices
in favour there :)

We can rethink that part if it will actually get merged.
