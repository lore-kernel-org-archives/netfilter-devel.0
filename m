I meant the state of the fragmented packets. If we let the uncompleted 
fragments to enter conntrack, as far as I see their state will be INVALID. 
Or should we add an exception and set their state to UNTRACKED in 
conntrack?

Actually, I have to agree with you.

I agree with your conclusion too, except a few question.

It is unclear for me how can you forward the packets to the next process: 
above you pointed out that in defrag/reassembly before conntrack we do not 
know yet whether the packets are destined to the host or not. So again, 
how would you let through the fragments on conntrack then?

I don't know how could the REJECT target help in any way.

This is not a simple case at all and I have to think that the "best" way 
just to drop the packets as we currently do.

Best regards,
Jozsef
