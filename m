Exactly.

Iptables operates on a per-table basis, so it is not only the INPUT or
OUTPUT chain that needs to be down and uploaded, but the whole filter
table.

And in addition, in my humble opinion the iptables ruleset should be up
to the user to maintain, once some kind of automatism starts to
add/remove rules on the fly, it becomes more difficult to do other
changes to add independent rules to the table. For example the user
needs to save the current ruleset using iptables-save, then modify the
resulting file, and then load it again. If the ruleset is generated as
it happens with a lot of tools, this might not be so easy.
