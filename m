It's a PMTU related problem, so I'd suggest to check first the next ones:

Aren't the ICMP error messages (i.e. fragmentation-needed) filtered out?
If not, does adding an explicit TCPMSS rule to the mangle table help?
Isn't there SACK options involved? Maybe there's a "smart" sequence 
number "anonymizer" device in the path which forgets about the SEQ numbers 
in the SACK options and thus such packets are marked as INVALID.

So tcpdumps captured at both sides could really help to tell what goes wrong.

Best regards,
Jozsef
