Linus,

I actually sent *one* buggy patch, and you already gave your feedback a=
nd NACK.

=46ine

I even relayed this to Stephen suggesting him not calling this a recurs=
ive lock.
(Note how I use 'suggesting' here)

So, what do you want from me ? Should I copy 100 times :

"I should not call it a recursive lock. I shall not invent new locking =
infra. I am a moron."=20
"I should not call it a recursive lock. I shall not invent new locking =
infra. I am a moron."=20
"I should not call it a recursive lock. I shall not invent new locking =
infra. I am a moron."=20
"I should not call it a recursive lock. I shall not invent new locking =
infra. I am a moron."=20
"I should not call it a recursive lock. I shall not invent new locking =
infra. I am a moron."=20
"I should not call it a recursive lock. I shall not invent new locking =
infra. I am a moron."=20
=2E..

OK done

Can we now proceed and continue ?

Thank you
