Conntrack loops are prevented by using a dummy conntrack, just as 
NOTRACK does.

I can think of a handful of applications:
 - CLASSIFY

 - When the cloned packets gets XFRMed or tunneled, its status switches 
   from "special" to "plain". Doing policy routing on them does not seem 
   so far-fetched.
