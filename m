What David and I have in mind is to use one array per mib instead of
two. This is an old idea.

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/15883/

When we know we run from BH context, we can use __this_cpu_inc(), but i=
f
we dont know or run from user/process context, we would need irqsafe_in=
c
variant.

=46or x86 this maps to same single instruction, but for other arches, t=
his
might be too expensive.

BTW, I think following patch is possible to save some text and useless
tests (on 64bit platform at least)

size vmlinux.old vmlinux

Thanks

[PATCH] snmp: SNMP_UPD_PO_STATS_BH() always called from softirq

We dont need to test if we run from softirq context.
