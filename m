	Agreed

	Yes, ip_vs_init fails.

	It is this case that can happen, we can only guess how
difficult is to get ENOMEM here. IIRC, we can generate only
ENOMEM error on IPVS core load.

	I assume Simon has such setup and changes code to
trigger load error. When I generate ENOMEM on IPVS core init
for such case I get ENOENT from register_ip_vs_app when
patch 1 and 2 for apps are applied, i.e. net->ipvs is NULL.
You can check it with NF_CONNTRACK=y, IP_VS=y and
IP_VS_FTP=m. You only need to trigger ENOMEM in __ip_vs_init.

	Probably but one check on load does not hurt much.
