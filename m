Had the function return "bool", it would have been obvious enough
what to do with its return type. A return type of "int" might have
hinted towards negative-is-error (in general) or strcmpish values
(functions doing string compare work).

Now that it returns "unsigned long", one is pressed to look at the=20
function body (not bad per se, but it is a hump) for the return=20
value's semantics.

Linus says bool is dangerous to the unsuspecting user=C2=A0=E2=80=94 bu=
t so is
"volatile", microwave ovens, etc. If the kernel really cared for
entry-level coders, it would be written in something like MISRA C.
