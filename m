Not only on router, but also on host, if conntrack fails to reassemble
fragments, the fragments will not be forwarded to IPv4/IPv6 stack.
So, these fragments can't be traced from MIB counter.

And, IPv4 conntrack records these fragments.
Is the context of IPv4 defragment different from IPv6?

Yes=EF=BC=8Cfor routers, the patch-set does not send icmp message to
source host. It only does on destination host with IPv6 connection=20
track enable.
