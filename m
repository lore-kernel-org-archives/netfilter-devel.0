Certainly it is true that increased use of RCU has resulted in new
requirements, which have in turn led to any number of changes over
the years.

Are you saying that people have already asked you for additional
variants of SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU?  If so, please don't keep them a secret!
Otherwise, experience indicates that it is best to wait for the new uses,
because they usually aren't quite what one might expect.
