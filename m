    netfilter: bridge: Disable PPPOE/VLAN processing by default
    
    The PPPOE/VLAN processing code in the bridge netfilter is broken
    by design.  The VLAN tag and the PPPOE session ID are an integral
    part of the packet flow information, yet they're completely
    ignored by the bridge netfilter.  This is potentially a security
    hole as it treats all VLANs and PPPOE sessions as the same.
    
    What's more, it's actually broken for PPPOE as the bridge netfilter
    tries to trim the packets to the IP length without adjusting the
    PPPOE header (and adjusting the PPPOE header isn't much better
    since the PPPOE peer may require the padding to be present).
    
    Therefore we should disable this by default.
    
    It does mean that people relying on this feature may lose networking
    depending on how their bridge netfilter rules are configured.
    However, IMHO the problems this code causes are serious enough to
    warrant this.
