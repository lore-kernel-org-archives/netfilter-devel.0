Hi Jan,

Thanks for your prompt review! I'll send v2 with the fixes you
suggested.

Sorry I missed that one.  Fixed in v2.

Yes.

Fixed.

Oops! Fixed in v2.  Also added sysfs_remove_file_from_group() if the
struct idletimer_tg allocation fails.

Fixed.

Yeps, this is a remain from the previous (and ugly) read from ipt_ip.
Fixed.

Yes, this is the only reason why I haven't put it under the net class,
which would probably look cleaner.  In other classes it seems to be
common to add misc attributes, but the net class (as of now) only
contains interface subclasses, as you said.

I'll change the FIXME to a clearer comment.
