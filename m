Kind of.  It's derived from the module name, not the filename.

I agree with that.

I imagine an eventual goal of standardizing the default
pr_fmt define in kernel.h to

	#define pr_fmt(fmt) KBUILD_MODNAME ": " fmt

so that all pr_<level> calls get this unless otherwise
specified.

Or perhaps better, to get rid of pr_fmt(fmt) altogether and
have printk emit the filename/modulename, function and/or
code offset by using something like %pS after the level.

I see the Makefile use, which I don't really like too much
because of the information hiding, as an intermediate step
until that's possible.
