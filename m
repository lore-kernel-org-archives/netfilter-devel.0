The runemomniagg2.sh script is still running, but the initial cycles profile 
suggests that the main change is converting the write_lock time into spinlock 
contention time with 78.39% of the cycles spent in ia64_spinlock_contention. 
When the script completes I'll upload the profiles and the netperf results to the 
same base URL as in the basenote under "contrack01/"
