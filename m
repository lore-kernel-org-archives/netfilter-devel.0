Me too, but I still prefer to do it properly once.

Not particulary. For cleanup a three stage approach with

1. init_net deactivation (ip_ct_attach = NULL)
2. generic netns cleanup
3. init_net specific final cleanup (slab cache, nf_conntrack_cachep,
    accounting, helpers, protocols, ...)

should work fine.

The initialization should be OK with just a init_net part
and a generic netns part.
