It does, and Pablo made up for this cost by moving the TTL tracking
to ingress where it actually belongs. This would obviously also be
possible without his patchset, but the fact is, nobody seemed to
have cared for the past ten years, we have from today a basically
zero cost feature and people can decide what the want for themselves,
there is no added cost for people not using it, there is no added
cost for people using ingress.

As for "really fit", ingress started off as living on a netfilter
hook and only moved to a direct invocation somewhere around 2.6.12
IIRC. As I was mentioning earlier, ingress *qdisc* is a hack in
itself since there is no freaking queuing, its a hack to invoke
classifier chains, so actually netfilter is *the better* abstraction
to do this. And it's not netfilter, its packet hooks for classification
purposes.

To me all these arguments have to very negative sounds. It has always
been like this - and it hasn't. And we want ingress queueing to be
the exclusive way to do this. And this quite frankly sucks for all
the reasons stated before. Its a hack, its not queueing, it doesn't
cost anything, let the people decide what they actually want to use.
