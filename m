Can you reproduce the same behaviour with the km algo?

So both 'from' and 'to' are inclusive which seems consistent to me. If
you make 'to' non-inclusive, then that will change the third example
above, right? That will break existing setups for people that are
relying on this behaviour. This has been exposed in this way for long
time, so we should avoid that breakage.

I would suggest you fix the --from X --to Y where X == Y which is not
doing what people would expect.
