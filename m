Conntrack is per net namespaces. You may have one container with conntrack 
enabled and another one without conntrack.

Moreover, if you may receive fragments of the same packet at different 
interfaces in different blades, then you may receive different whole 
packets of the same flow at different interfaces/blades. But stateful 
firewalling relies on the assumption that all packets goes through of the 
firewall. Because it's not assured, conntrack may not run in the 
containers you denoted as FW LXC.
