Which is why the zone thing is added.

Ah, but I now see that you need to select a zone for it first.. touch=C3=
=A9.

Still this SNAT-on-INPUT leaves a second taste. Adding another address=20
to the tunnel master and using DNAT-on-PREROUTING for local deliveries=20
would have also made the connections unambiguous.
