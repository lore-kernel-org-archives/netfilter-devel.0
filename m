We do support all families using the regular NF_QUEUE verdict of course.
But yes, nf_queue.c will simply drop packets that don't have a netfilter
AF registered.

But my question is whether queueing is something that is even worth
considering for the NFPROTO_NETDEV family. As I said, it will at best
work for ingress anyways and that will actually be more tricky than just
calling skb_share_check(), we need to take care of keeping valid
references to all the data you currently store in the CB, including the
packet_type, the device, things attached to the skb at this point to
the stack etc.

If we decide not to support queueing for this family we don't have to
use netfilter hooks for this and all the refactoring for async resume
becomes unnecessary.
