Too much effort. Really.

Maybe if you have a very small network - just one or two subnets, one=20
router... Again - maybe. It is definitely not going to work on a large,=
=20
multisite network with many intermediate routers.

All you can do on edge devices is checking client's MAC, requring 802.1=
X=20
and making sure that IP matches MAC (and possibly DHCP lease) and=20
similar things.
