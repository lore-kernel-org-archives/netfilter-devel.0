Yes.  bridge<->netfilter wiring is pure duct tape.
The glue code will set up a fake rtable for the skb after the
prerouting hook. [ see br_nf_pre_routing_finish() ].

I think none of these are an option.

I fail to understand why a bridge should honor/modifiy IP options.

For the 'local delivery' case the ip stack will take care of
option parsing, for forwarding it should be sufficient to do
sanity tests (for netfilters sake).

>From a quick glance, it should be sufficient to edit
br_parse_ip_options() and remove everything after

memset(IPCB(skb), 0, sizeof(struct inet_skb_parm));

A 2nd step would be to move a copy of ip_options_compile()
into br_netfilter.c and trim it down to only validate the
ipv4 header without modifying it.

If there is a good reason to mangle options on a bridge i'd
prefer a comment explaining them...
