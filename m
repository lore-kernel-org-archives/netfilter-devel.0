Well, I tried documenting exactly what it did and did not do, which got
an ack from Peter.

However, my later pull request spawned a bit of discussion:

	https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=149730349001044

This discussion led me to propose strengthening spin_unlock_wait()
to act as a lock/unlock pair.  This can be implemented on x86 as
an smp_mb() followed by a read-only spinloop, as shown on branch
spin_unlock_wait.2017.06.23a on my -rcu tree.

Linus was not amused, and said that if we were going to make
spin_unlock_wait() have the semantics of lock+unlock, we should just
open-code that, especially given that there are way more definitions
of spin_unlock_wait() than there are uses.  He also suggested making
spin_unlock_wait() have only acquire semantics (x86 spin loop with
no memory-barrier instructions) and add explicit barriers where
required.

	https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=149860012913036

I did a series for this which may be found on branch
spin_unlock_wait.2017.06.27a on my -rcu tree.

This approach was not loved by others (see later on the above thread), and
Linus's reply (which reiterated his opposition to lock+unlock semantics)
suggested the possibility of removing spin_unlock_wait() entirely.

	https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=149869476911620

So I figured, in for a penny, in for a pound, and therefore did the series
that includes this patch.  The most recent update (which does not yet
include your improved version) is on branch spin_unlock_wait.2017.06.30b
of my -rcu tree.

Hey, you asked!  ;-)
