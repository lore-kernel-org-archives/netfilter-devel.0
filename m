ipt_REJECT is fine, ip_route_input() is only used in NF_IP_FORWARD.
But you're right about multicast/broadcast still causing problems,
I'll have another look.

No, ip_route_me_harder() can be called for packets with non-local
source. ip_route_output_slow() rejects non-local source addresses,
so the only way to use them for policy routing is by using
ip_route_input().
