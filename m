With the latest kernel I see that: LVS accepts connections, selects right destination (if round robin is selected destination changes accoring it), then it detects that it is local node and do:
net/netfilter/ipvs/ip_vs_xmit.c:
   ip_vs_null_xmit(struct sk_buff *skb, struct ip_vs_conn *cp,
 struct ip_vs_protocol *pp)

Which does nothing with skb. (here I do not understand what happens with that packet then)
I think if VLS could change destination for packets which go from local node to local node then connection can be established. Is it reasonable?
