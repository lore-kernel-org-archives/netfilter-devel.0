Looks problematic since address changes post ipv6 dnat translations,
its certainly unexpected for nft since we have magic address mangling
after -2 and 0 priroized tables...

However ... how is ILA supposed to work?

ila_xlat_outgoing has no callers, so it appears we only do this
stateless nat on ingress...?
