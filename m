Hi Pablo,

please consider this fix for v3.19.

It resolves a crash in xfrm reported by Florian Wiessner.

I believe this problem manifests since 0a5ebb8000c5 ("ipv4: Pass explicit
daddr arg to ip_send_reply().") which was included in v2.6.39.

Julian reports that the patch has been tested on net tree (Dec 7), 3.14.25,
3.12.33, 3.10.61. 3.4.104 needs a modified fix that resolves rejects. It
applies with little fuzz on 3.2.64. Please let us know if we should post
separate 3.2 and 3.4 patches.


The following changes since commit e8781f70a5b210a1b08cff8ce05895ebcec18d83:
