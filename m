Hi David,

The following patchset contains Netfilter updates for your net-next tree,
mostly ipset improvements and enhancements features, they are:

* Don't call ip_nest_end needlessly in the error path from me, suggested
  by Pablo Neira Ayuso, from Jozsef Kadlecsik.

* Fixed sparse warnings about shadowed variable and missing rcu annotation
  and fix of "may be used uninitialized" warnings, also from Jozsef.

* Renamed simple macro names to avoid namespace issues, reported by David
  Laight, again from Jozsef.

* Use fix sized type for timeout in the extension part, and cosmetic
  ordering of matches and targets separatedly in xt_set.c, from Jozsef.

* Support package fragments for IPv4 protos without ports from Anders K.
  Pedersen. For example this allows a hash:ip,port ipset containing the
  entry 192.168.0.1,gre:0 to match all package fragments for PPTP VPN
  tunnels to/from the host. Without this patch only the first package
  fragment (with fragment offset 0) was matched.

* Introduced a new operation to get both setname and family, from Jozsef.
  ip[6]tables set match and SET target need to know the family of the set
  in order to reject adding rules which refer to a set with a non-mathcing
  family. Currently such rules are silently accepted and then ignored
  instead of generating an error message to the user.

* Reworked extensions support in ipset types from Jozsef. The approach of
  defining structures with all variations is not manageable as the
  number of extensions grows. Therefore a blob for the extensions is
  introduced, somewhat similar to conntrack. The support of extensions
  which need a per data destroy function is added as well.

* When an element timed out in a list:set type of set, the garbage
  collector skipped the checking of the next element. So the purging
  was delayed to the next run of the gc, fixed by Jozsef.

* A small Kconfig fix: NETFILTER_NETLINK cannot be selected and
  ipset requires it.

* hash:net,net type from Oliver Smith. The type provides the ability to
  store pairs of subnets in a set.

* Comment for ipset entries from Oliver Smith. This makes possible to
  annotate entries in a set with comments, for example:

  ipset n foo hash:net,net comment
  ipset a foo 10.0.0.0/21,192.168.1.0/24 comment "office nets A and B"

* Fix of hash types resizing with comment extension from Jozsef.

* Fix of new extensions for list:set type when an element is added
  into a slot from where another element was pushed away from Jozsef.

* Introduction of a common function for the listing of the element
  extensions from Jozsef.

* Net namespace support for ipset from Vitaly Lavrov.

* hash:net,port,net type from Oliver Smith, which makes possible
  to store the triples of two subnets and a protocol, port pair in
  a set.

* Get xt_TCPMSS working with net namespace, by Gao feng.

* Use the proper net netnamespace to allocate skbs, also by Gao feng.

* A couple of cleanups for the conntrack SIP helper, by Holger
  Eitzenberger.

* Extend cttimeout to allow setting default conntrack timeouts via
  nfnetlink, so we can get rid of all our sysctl/proc interfaces in
  the future for timeout tuning, from me.
