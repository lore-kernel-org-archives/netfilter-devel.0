I was hoping to get it into this merge window, but but I agree it is a
bit late for that.  If I had succeeded in posting it to the correct list
address back in February it wouldn't be late.

That context was already posted here:
	https://www.redhat.com/archives/linux-audit/2014-February/msg00102.html
	https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/2/19/481

I discovered later I used a stale list address for netdev and didn't Cc
you directly, so you likely would have missed it.

No problem.  It was recommended I resend patch 3/5 of that set,
isolated, to get it reviewed here.  These recent changes to that patch
should not affect patches 1, 2, 4, 5 of that original patch context.

Does that help?
