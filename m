  Indeed, thanks for spotting it.

  Yes, it's racy, but I this is true for the "regular" socket lookup, too. 
Take UDP for example: __udp4_lib_rcv() does the socket lookup, gets a 
reference to the socket, and then calls udp_queue_rcv_skb() to queue the 
skb. As far as I can see there's nothing there which prevents the socket 
from being closed between these calls. sk_common_release() even documents 
this behaviour:

	[...]
	if (sk->sk_prot->destroy)
		sk->sk_prot->destroy(sk);

	/*
	 * Observation: when sock_common_release is called, processes have
	 * no access to socket. But net still has.
	 * Step one, detach it from networking:
	 *
	 * A. Remove from hash tables.
	 */

	sk->sk_prot->unhash(sk);

	/*
	 * In this point socket cannot receive new packets, but it is possible
	 * that some packets are in flight because some CPU runs receiver and
	 * did hash table lookup before we unhashed socket. They will achieve
	 * receive queue and will be purged by socket destructor.
	 *
	 * Also we still have packets pending on receive queue and probably,
	 * our own packets waiting in device queues. sock_destroy will drain
	 * receive queue, but transmitted packets will delay socket destruction
	 * until the last reference will be released.
	 */
	[...]

  Of course it's true that doing early lookups and storing that reference 
in the skb widens the window considerably, but I think this race is 
already handled. Or is there anything I don't see?
