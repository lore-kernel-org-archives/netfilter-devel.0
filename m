Yes. But still it is a question of viewpoint what kind of behaviour is
correct.  Let's say a single packet is accounted in ct_acct, and then
sent to multiple interfaces, where on more than one of them it gets
unbilled.  So we add once, but 'unbill' (i prefer the term subtract)
more than once.   In the end the ct_acct counter will be less than when
it first encountered the packet.

I don't really understand what you want to say.  You want accounting
that is not conntrack-based?  well, then you should maybe look at
one of the many methods, ranging from iptables rule counters to the ipt_acc=
t match/target, nacctd, pcap-mmap, PF_RING, ULOG-based, ...

btw, they all account the amount of RX packet on inbound interface and
do not 'unbill' ;)
