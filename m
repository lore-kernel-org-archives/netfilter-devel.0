I am not sure my day job will permit me to polish a patch mixing all
the bits and comments. But I am glad we eventually got back spinlocks
which are probably better than rwlocks for implementing this stuff.

Instead of submitting a full patch again, we could first submit a new
 include file containg all comments and inline functions ?

This include file could be local to netfilter, with a big stick on
it to forbids its use on other areas (No changes in Documentation/ )

Then, as soon as we can go back to pure RCU solution, we can safely
delete this controversial-locking-nesting-per-cpu-thing ?


Instead of local/global name that Paul suggested, that was about
'global' locking all locks at the same time. Not any more the good
name IMHO

Maybe something like local/remote or owner/foreigner ?

xt_info_owner_lock_bh(), xt_info_owner_unlock_bh()
xt_info_foreigner_lock(), xt_info_foreigner_unlock()

One comment about this comment you wrote :

/*
 * The "writer" side needs to get exclusive access to the lock,
 * regardless of readers.  This must be called with bottom half
 * processing (and thus also preemption) disabled.=20
 */
static inline void xt_info_wrlock(unsigned int cpu)
{
	spin_lock(&per_cpu(xt_info_locks, cpu).lock);
}

static inline void xt_info_wrunlock(unsigned int cpu)
{
	spin_unlock(&per_cpu(xt_info_locks, cpu).lock);
}

Its true that BH should be disabled if caller runs
on the cpu it wants to lock.=20
=46or other ones (true foreigners), there is
no requirement about BH (current cpu could be interrupted
by a softirq and packets could fly)

We could use following construct and not require disabling BH
more than a short period of time.
(But preemption disabled for the whole duration)

preempt_disable(); // could be cpu_migration_disable();

int curcpu =3D smp_processor_id();
/*
 * Gather stats for current cpu : must disable BH
 * before trying to lock.
 */
local_bh_disable();
xt_info_wrlock(curcpu);
// copy stats of this cpu on my private data (not shown here)
xt_info_wrunlock(curcpu);
local_bh_enable();

for_each_possible_cpu(cpu) {
	if (cpu =3D=3D curcpu)
		continue;
	xt_info_wrlock(cpu);
	// fold stats of "cpu" on my private data (not shown here)
	xt_info_wrunlock((cpu);
}
preempt_enable(); // could be cpu_migration_enable();


So your initial comment could be changed to :

/*
 * The "writer" side needs to get exclusive access to the lock,
 * regardless of readers. If caller is about to lock its own lock,
 * he must have disabled BH before. For other cpus, no special
 * care but preemption disabled to guarantee no cpu migration.
 */

Back to work now :)
