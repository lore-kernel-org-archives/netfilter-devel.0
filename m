Hm, how does one do traditional logging to syslog? Some of us just do
logging for debugging purposes and would not otherwise need the full-blown
nf_log solution - let alone there be enough space on some constrained
hardware for a thorough logger (say, WRT54).

Does it use the old limit code (which has numerous accuracy problems
it seems), or will it magically make use of the rate estimator?

The libnl repositories (both original and yours) is missing tags.
(Cc'ing Thomas).
The unannotated tags can be got from git://dev.medozas.de/libnl .

This makes it easier to get version numbers instead of
"cannot describe $sha1".

Missing a tag too, I think you (Patrick) can add it still :)

How about storing the actual text the user inputed in something like
an -m comment, as an aid to the user for finding his rules again
after they have been optimized internally?
