But isn't this like a trivial thing to do, hardly something you want 
to add a netfilter dependency for?

In addition to cycling through your own addresses for responding to 
unicast queries, you also respond to a specific set of addresses which 
have been explicitly configured somewhere? (with a configuration tool 
like 'arp', e.g. KAME has 'ndp' for that)
