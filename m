I like that approach. Saves me adding that line to .c
files repeatedly.

I object to that. You would be spamming the dmesg ring buffer
with all that info, plus

filename: you would have to keep filename strings in the kernel.
Surely I do not find that thrilling when there are ~18000
non-arch .[ch] files whose pathnames amount to 542K.
Same goes similar for functions.

modulename: obj-y files would only get "<built-in>" or something
for KBUILD_MODNAME. Printing that to dmesg is not too useful.

I would rather keep plain printk as-is.
