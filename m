avoiding the nft vs tc vs ebpf debate I will the ingress qlock is not
needed anymore I just haven't got to removing it yet. Its not actually
protecting any data structures though.

I was hoping to push the skb lists onto something like rte_ring
used by the DPDK folks or possibly some of the lockless ring work Jesper
created. This is needed for many qdisc's to drop the qlock but not the
ingress qdisc. Been busy working on switch bits lately but might be
able to pick this up next merge window.

Thanks,
John
