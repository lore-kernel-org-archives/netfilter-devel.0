The raise was triggered in a scenario when we tested high-load IPsec
tunnels and flushed the conntrack hashs from userspace.

=46or me there is little difference in choosing DROP or ACCEPT as verdi=
ct.
The packet/skb belongs to a formerly allowed connection, most likely
this connection is still allowed (but the conntrack hash entry is about
to be removed due to userspace is flushing the conntrack table).

To minimize the impact (lost packets -> retransmit) I decided to allow
the skb in flight, so were is no lost packet at this place.

When the connection is not allowed anymore (but was allowed up to now,
because the hash entry exists), the impact is one last packet 'slipping
through'.

Today I would still decide the way I did in 2010.
