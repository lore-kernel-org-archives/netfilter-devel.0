Did you notice all the attempts to send a corrected patch?  v6 finally
got it right (sent Monday).  Sorry for all the noise.  Serve me right
for not sitting on my hands before sending the email for a bit while I
checked it.

It was tested, but the patched code wasn't actually checked in.  It was
still in my tree.  I ran "git commit --amend" more than once, forgetting
the "-a", and didn't carefully enough inspect the resulting patch.
