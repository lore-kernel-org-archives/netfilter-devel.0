I'm aware of the problem space.

I was suggesting that to trigger the quiescent state and to wait for 
it to propagate it would be enough to reuse the reschedule 
mechanism.

It would be relatively straightforward: first a send-reschedule then 
do a wait_task_context_switch() on rq->curr - both are existing 
primitives. (a task reference has to be taken but that's pretty much 
all)

By the time wait_task_context_switch() returns from the last CPU we 
know that the quiescent state has passed.
