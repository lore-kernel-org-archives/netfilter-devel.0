Hmm. If you somewhere get the fd to a socket from another namespace, it
definitely does work (I'm currently implementing my "socketat" with fd
passing through AF_UNIX sockets, so i know it works), so the

  setns(other...)
  fd = socket(...)
  setns(orig...)

sequence would certainly work. However, there might be other things
happening inbetween like a signal (imagine AIO particularly). While
signals are user-controllable (and therefore to be managed/excluded by
the user), we need to think if there are other problems with doing this
as sequence?

If there are no other problematic conditions with this, socketat should
probably be moved to a user library.
