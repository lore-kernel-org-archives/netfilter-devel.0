Now you mentioned it, cluster match is not as flexible right now,
its hashing is on source_ip only.

Many people still use ipt_CLUSTERIP, and probably for couple of years.

This issue was raised several times, we should fix CLUSTERIP for good.

Thanks

[PATCH v4] netfilter: ipt_CLUSTERIP: remove "no conntrack!"

When a packet is meant to be handled by another node of the cluster,
silently drop it instead of flooding kernel log.

Note : INVALID packets are also dropped without notice.
