If ifindices change for the same device name then that would be a bug.
The only time they should change is if a) you reboot or b) you unload a
module after ifconfiged down the device(s) and then reload it later.
In both cases if you have exactly the same setup, the chances of those
ifindices changing are very slim.

You may wanna listen to new devices being created and add to the ifindex
list.

This is a valid reason for the string compare given the way iptables is
architected.

you could optimize. There can be only one ppp* list for all rules to
share and you iterate not the rules rather the table which holds the
ifindices. Could be 1-2 lookup to find the ifindex if proper hashing is
used.
