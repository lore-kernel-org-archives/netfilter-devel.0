Totally agree with you that the situation is quite a mess. From tc ingress/
egress side, at least my use case is to have an as minimal as possible entry
point for cls_bpf/act_bpf, which is what we were working on recently. That
is rather ``fresh'' compared to the remaining history of cls/act in tc.
