We faced a similar problem: we wanted to not only differentiate between ppp 
and pptp interfaces but even between different providers connected via ppp 
and pptp.

We ended up predefining all possible providers in the rules and differentiate 
between them using the ipt_condition module. This module is not very 
well-loved in the netfilter community but there are usecases like this where 
it comes in handy.

Maybe this is a solution for you too.

The problem with the current solution is not only speed and maintainability 
but also locking: if two device up/down events happen at the same time in 
this scenario, the tabels will become wrong until you develop some kind of 
userspace locking.

Kind regards,
