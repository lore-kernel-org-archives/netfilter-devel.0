Eric, it would be nice to acknowledge David's suggestion that this hash
size is always power of two here, because otherwise at least your words
about the same hash distribution according to the "%" variant could be
wrong (but I don't say the final result would be wrong). Maybe I mix
up these sizes, but it seems this could be set by a user, and I didn't
find anything about this power of two necessity?
