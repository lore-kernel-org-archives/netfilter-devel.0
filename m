Thought, could the shrunk table use the same locks as the lower half
of the old table?

I also wonder whether shrinking hash tables is ever actually worth
the effort. Most likely they'll need to grow again very quickly.

Acquiring 3 locks of much the same type looks like a locking hierarchy
violation just waiting to happen.
