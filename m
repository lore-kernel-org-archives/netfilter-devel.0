OK... I'm going to place this in the nf.git tree... but this is very ugly.

So Eric, I'd really appreciate if you can follow up once this has hit
nf-next.git and we get rid of the rtnl_lock and net_lock mutex by
propagating up to the the caller the hook registration from init_net()
and unregistering this from exit_net(). So we don't need to loop on
the existing netns but we use the existing netns init and exit
callbacks.

Let me know, thanks.
