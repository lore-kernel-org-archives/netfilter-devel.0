Cc'ing netdev, since this is now a very clear proposal and not some
internal netfilter rambling.

yes, and this is desired.   However, the packets also hit PREROUTING
twice, which is exactly what we want (and get it for free, since
xfrm4_input.c calls netif_rx() again). =20

However, it doesn't reset the skb->nfct pointer, so connection tracking
sees both encapsulated and decapsulated packet as belonging to the same
connection.  This is wrong, and dangerous (application helpers might be
called for the encapsulated traffic, which now has a completely
different layer 4 protocol.

So with stock 2.6.x you have=20

Did anybody propose ugly hacks in the routing table?

yes, it is symmetric.  As is the symmetry between prerouting/postrouting
and input/output hooks. As well as the symmetry between SNAT and DNAt,

Yes, that's why what IPsec is doing for incoming ESP/AH packets the
right thing: go through PRE_ROUTING, route to LOCAL_IN, decapsulate,
and start over again.

However, for outgoing ESP/AH packets (locally-encapsulated), it doesn't
show the symmetric behaviour of what it does on the input side: go
through FORWARD, encapsulate, route, POST_ROUTING.  No starting over.

So we absolutely _need_ a symmetric-to-incoming behaviour like:

a) for locally-originated packets
LOCAL_OUT, POST_ROUTING, encapsulate, LOCAL_OUT, POST_ROUTING.

b) for forwarded, locally-encapsulated packets
PRE_ROUTING, FORWARD, POST_ROUTING, encapsulate, LOCAL_OUT, POST_ROUTING.

No, we don't achieve this by manipulating the routing code, but by
placing the respective hooks in ah{4,6}.c and esp{4,6}.c
{ah,esp}_output() function respectively. We also need to (again) reset
the skb->nfct and drop the conntrack reference again.

This way we=20
	1) make connection tracking work again
	2) do not change any routing of the current implementation
	3) enable users to
		a) filter unencapsulated, encapsulated and decapsulated
		   packeets at their 'expected' place
		b) do DNAT on the incoming decapsulated packets
		   (which doesn't work right now, but should)
		c) do SNAT on the outgoing/forwarded to-be-encapsualated
		   packets (which doesn't work right now, but should)

I'm not proposing to route before encapsulating.  I just propose of
calling the same netfilter functions that we usually call before/after
routing at different places :)
