Interesting .. if this isn't real there is most likely some problem with
HW checksumming in netfilter. What does ethtool -k <dev> show?

Could be because of net_ratelimit() message surpressing.

I'm not aware of any special handling for SACKs that would make it fail,
especially considering that ICMP also fails, but I'm going to look into
it.

Thanks, this is even more evidence for HW checksumming problems, these
existed for a long time.

Another sign pointing to HW checksumming ..
