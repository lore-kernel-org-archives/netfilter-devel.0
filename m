It is a short-term expedient course of action.  Longer term, I will drop
rcuclassic in favor of rcutree, and then merge rcupreempt into rcutree.
I will then add machinery to rcutree to handle expedited grace periods
(somewhat) more naturally.  Trying to expedite three very different RCU
implementations seems a bit silly, hence the current off-on-the-side
approach.

But even then I will avoid relying on a "barrier" callback, or, indeed,
any sort of callback, because we don't want expedited grace periods to
have to wait on invocation of earlier RCU callbacks.  There will thus
not be a call_rcu_expedited(), at least not unless someone comes up with
a -really- compelling reason why.

But the exercise of going through several possible implementations was
quite useful, as I learned a number of things that will improve the
eventual rcutree implementation.  Like the fact that expedited grace
periods don't want to be waiting on invocation of prior callbacks.  ;-)

And rcutiny is, as always, as special case.  Here is the implementation
of synchronize_rcu_expedited() in rcutiny:

	void synchronize_rcu_expedited(void)
	{
	}

Or even:

	#define synchronize_rcu_expedited synchronize_rcu

;-)
