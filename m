Sorry I miss something.

nf_ct_l4proto_unregister_sysctl also uses .compat to identify if we
can unregister the compat sysctl.

if we register l4proto_tcp and l4proto_tcp6 both. without .compat,
when unregister l4proto_tcp6, the compat sysctl will be unregister too.

So maybe we have to use .compat.
