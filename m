Jan, Patrick,

I would like to get this bug in old Linux kernels documented in the
iptables man page, since it is pretty serious. The fix made into 2.6.39
and I would like to have it backported to 2.6.32-longterm and
2.6.33-longterm. If you disagree with the backport to -longterm please
let me know, I would update the patch accordingly.

---

In Linux kernels up to and including 2.6.38, with the exception of longterm
releases 2.6.32.42 (or later) and 2.6.33.15 (or later), there is a bug (*) whereby
IPv6 TOS mangling does not behave as documented and differs from the IPv4
version. The TOS mask indicates the bits one wants to zero out, so it needs to
be inverted before applying it to the original TOS field. However, the
aformentioned kernels forgo the inversion which breaks --set-tos and its
mnemonics.

(*) Fixed by upstream commit:
    1ed2f73d90fb49bcf5704aee7e9084adb882bfc5 (netfilter: IPv6: fix DSCP mangle code)
