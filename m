It seems or patch change something (but it is just showing debug, strange), 
or there is something fixed between 2.6.25-rc7-git1 and 2.6.25-rc7-git3. LC-
trie working fine, HASH also i cannot see any leaks.

I  will have to wait 5-6 hours to make sure. After this time pass, if i will 
not see bug again, i will try to run kernel just with default debug like 
before.

If it is required, i can test performance and cpu load with/without routing 
cache on real workload. Sure it is better to have syntetic tests before that.
