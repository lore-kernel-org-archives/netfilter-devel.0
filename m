I agree.

Fwiw, I believe this behavior came in as a regression via commit
c0c09bfdc415 ("rhashtable: avoid unnecessary wakeup for worker queue").
Initially, if no max_shift was specified, we'd just expand further.

I can take care of these above two fixups tomorrow, if you want.
I presume you want to route both via -net, or just the growth limit
issue via -net?

I also have some optimizations I was working on last week for
net-next, but I would wait for a -net into -net-next merge after
that to avoid merge conflicts, if that's fine. ;)

Thanks,
Daniel
