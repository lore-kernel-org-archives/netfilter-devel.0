Because libraries like libnl already handle this transparently for
various user space apps. Those apps are not even aware of the problem
and always get a consistent dump if the kernel implements INTR.

Because making it synchronous does not help the Netlink dump problem
at all, see below.

Also, a sync resize causes a random inserts/removal to take a lot
longer. This leads to less predictable insert/removal times. I have
no objection to offering both sync and async resizing as long as the
choice of balance is configurable.

How? Do you want to hold the mutex while the user is reading? I don't
see how to achieve consistency with locking without introducing a ton
of complexity and attackable behaviour like user space being able to
delay inserts. If at all this only seems acceptable for privileged
users.

My vote is to rely on the proven INTR flag and optionally restart the
dump if user space did not indicate that INTR is supported as Patrick
suggested.
