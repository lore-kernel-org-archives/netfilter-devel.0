Another option that was brought up (although perhaps not very clearly 
since it isn't listed here) was the embedding of the personal firewall 
hooks into the individual LSMs roughly similar to how capabilities are 
handled with SELinux today (a separate security mechanism that has 
explicit calls within SELinux).  This approach enables the use of 
current LSMs (although minor modifications will be needed) and avoids 
the need to add new hooks to the core network stack.

Since there will always be a significant userspace component to any 
personal firewall approach it seems reasonable to push the decision 
making into userspace and leave the kernel component relatively simple.  
The basic idea behind Samir's "snet" concept where the kernel simply 
passes messages to userspace and waits for a verdict seems like a 
reasonable approach in that it can be made to support different 
personal firewall implementations/designs without significant changes 
to the kernel.
