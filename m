Well, rhashtable (or generally resizing) will make it a lot worse.
Usually we at worst miss entries which were added during the dump,
which is made up by the notifications.

With resizing we might miss anything, its completely undeterministic.

I don't see how. The problem is that the ordering of the hash changes
and it will skip different entries than those that have already been
dumped.
