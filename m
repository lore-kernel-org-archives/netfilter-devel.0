excuse for this loosely patches...
please more explain...
do you mean my patches are too long? or ambiguous?
i 've tried to code base on "Documentation/CodingStyle".. and patch
base on "how to participate in the kernel community" documents.

the core of this framework is located at pkt_tables.c&.h (#2&#3 of
kernel patches).
iptables.c&.h are completely changed. also at the user space libiptc.c
is rewritten from scratch thus their patches are really ambiguous to
be understood..what is the best way to send this patches?
what this phrase mean: "' remotely match existing code ""?

ok, i 've used this style to free list elements.
if you mean "don't use direct access to prev/next", i 'll review my
code and will try to use list iteration function on every place that
is possible or at list use list functions and list element of
structures instead of direct access to "next/prev"..
