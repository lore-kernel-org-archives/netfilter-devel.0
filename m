afaik, two places:
1. translate_table -> find_check_entry -> check_target -> xt_check_target
most iptables operations go there and .entryinfo is set in check_target
with struct ipt_entry *e, which is an iptable rule, so can't be NULL.
(as well as ip6table in netfilter/ip6_tables.c )

2. nft_target_init -> xt_check_target, where nft_target_set_tgchk_param
does the exact thing to set .entryinfo with a local varible union nft_entry e:
union nft_entry {
        struct ipt_entry e4;
        struct ip6t_entry e6;
        struct ebt_entry ebt;
        struct arpt_entry arp;
};

case 2 is actually what nft does to use xt targets, so net/sched
action should do
the same.
