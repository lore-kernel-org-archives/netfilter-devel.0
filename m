I am too. Good stuff.
I think 99.9% of accounting would be happy with getting data after the
call is done; the other 0.01% may have to live with extra packets later
which undo things. 
Are you working on something along the IPFIX protocol for transport?

Let me think about it.
Clearly the best place to account for things is on the wire once the
packet has left the box ;-> So the closest you are to the wire, the
better. How open are you to move accounting further down? My thoughts
are along the lines of incrementing the contrack counters at the qdisc
level. Since you transport after the structure has been deleted, it
should work out fine and fair billing will be taken care of.

Yikes. That sort of kills my thought above ;->
Has someone done experimented and figured how expensive it would be to
do it at the qdisc level? Note, you can probably have a low level
grained
lock just for stats.

Agreed.

Heres thinking developed while responding to you.
Contracking to use generic stats counters that we plan to use for MPLS
(amongst other things). I have attached a patch i was going to shoot to
Dave - needs testing against latest kernels. The code is reproduced from
the net/sched.

My thinking is that at the qdisc level instead of saying things like:
sch->stats.packets++;
you do:
INC_STATS(skb,sch->stats,reason_code)

INC_STATS is generic (goes in the generic stats code in attached patch)
and will have an ifdef for contrack billing (which includes unbilling
depending on reason code). Reason code could be results that are now
returned.
As an example NET_XMIT_DROP is definetely unbilling while
NET_XMIT_SUCCESS implies bill. 

I think the current stats structure may not cover all cases but we can
discuss that before i push patch to Dave.

cheers,
jamal

+   This code is NOT intended to be used for statistics collection,

+   If you need only statistics, run a user level daemon which
+   periodically reads byte counters.
+
+   Unfortunately, rate estimation is not a very easy task.
+   F.e. I did not find a simple way to estimate the current peak rate
+   and even failed to formulate the problem 8)8)
+
+   So I preferred not to built an estimator into the scheduler,
+   but run this task separately.
+   Ideally, it should be kernel thread(s), but for now it runs
+   from timers, which puts apparent top bounds on the number of rated
+   flows, has minimal overhead on small, but is enough
+   to handle controlled load service, sets of aggregates.
+
+   We measure rate over A=(1<<interval) seconds and evaluate EWMA:
+
+   avrate = avrate*(1-W) + rate*W
+
+   where W is chosen as negative power of 2: W = 2^(-ewma_log)
