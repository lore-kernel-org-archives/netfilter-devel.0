That makes complete sense to me. I was wondering whether the original
IPv4 fix was the correct one from the nf core perspective - but it
seems like perhaps it is, given that ip_defrag() has a lot more users
from a lot more different paths which are likely relying on the skb to
be orphaned. In comparison, in the IPv6 path, nf_ct_frag6_gather() is
only called from OVS and the netfilter hooks; the hooks already do the
orphaning, so it's more consistent for OVS to do it as well.

Sure, I'll resend the patch making the fix in OVS.
