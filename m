There is the possibility that some users have -m conntrack in their
mangle table in the PREROUTING chain. However, I am pretty sure that
if there are such users, they do it because of the layer-3/4/5/7 part
and not care about bridge so much.

On secondary thought, one could also argue that because conntrack=20
ignores the interface, two unrelated connections happening to be routed=
=20
through the same machine(*) are tracked as one, too.
