Thanks. The problem appears to be that ip6_route_me_harder()
only uses the socket's oif for the route lookup when the
socket is bound to an interface, but radvd uses IPV6_PKTINFO
to specify the outgoing interface.

I guess netfilter shouldn't be overriding IPV6_PKTINFO, but
we unfortunately have neither an indication of this nor the
original route lookup keys available at the time the packet
is rerouted.
