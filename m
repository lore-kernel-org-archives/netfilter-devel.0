If the goal is to enter a container you are probably right.  I don't
think I have seen how scary the cloneat code is.

At least for the network namespace there is a lot of value in being
able to just change that single namespace.  Having multiple logical
network stacks has it's challenges but has a lot of practical
applications.  Especially when there is the possibility of private
ipv4 addresses overlapping, or you have interfaces where you never
want to forward between them but you want forwarding enabled.
