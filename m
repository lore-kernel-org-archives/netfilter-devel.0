It's always possible.

Just ignore line length limitations for formats.

If the formats are on a separate line, checkpatch
won't complain either.

If nf_cg_helper_log was named nf_cg_helper_printk
checkpatch wouldn't complain if the original line
with format was > 80 cols

		nf_ct_helper_printk(skb, ct, "some really long format past 80 cols ...");

but then the log isn't really a printk either and
that's a checkpatch limitation on understanding
what is and isn't a logging output function.
