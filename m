How exactly are dynamic ports handled? Do you just add a catch-all rule
that filters based on socket lookups?

In that case you could do something like this:

ip route add local default dev lo scope host table 1
ip rule add fwmark 0x1 lookup 1

and still use the socket lookups for marking, which would (without the
socket caching) remove the need for this patch entirely.

We support bitwise use of the mark everywhere in current kernels, so
that shouldn't be a problem anymore.
