Yes, what you guess is what i want to ask. :-)
Should end hosts which are using conntrack send a fragment reassembly time exceeded message?

There are two point:
1.Take security into account, end hosts also used conntrack. 

  For example: When a host is attacked by denial of service TCP flaws, RedHat used the conntrack&recent
  match to limit the TCP connections.
  
  About details, see the phenomenon description:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4609
    http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2008-4609

  See RedHat's solution:
    http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-18730
 

2.On the latest kernel, a router on which the conntrack is used, reassemble fragments and 
  forward reassembled intact packet. This implementation is not coincide with what you said.

  nf_defrag_ipv4 module is registered on PRE_ROUTING hook with the highest priority. So, search router table 
  after completing the reassembly and forward it to destination host.


If I miss something, please tell me.

Thanks.
