Not required at this place - all users are already unregistered and
no code can access this list except module exit path.

It is enough here, rcu_barrier() will wait until all scheduled
call_rcu() are completed, that's what we need. But in some cases we
should only wait for the whole grace period to elapse, then one has to use
synchronize_rcu() and friends. rcu_barrier() will wait for the callbacks
to be executed, while they are executed after grace period has elapsed,
so it implicitly includes synchronize_rcu(), but effectively they are
the same: both functions register rcu callback and wait for the
completion, rcu_barrier() is a bit more enhanced, since it has several
types.

Those are essentially the same - synchronize_net() has additional
might_sleep()  call. Both will wait until grace period elapced - i.e.
all currently RCU protected sections completed.

It will wait until all scheduled rcu callbacks are executed.

So from the description they look different, but implementation
suggestes that effectively they are the same, except that there are a
bit different invocation types for the barrier.
