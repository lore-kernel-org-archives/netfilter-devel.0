   This patch cleans up functions in ipv6 stack:
   
    - export route6_me_harder() as ip6_route_harder() and
      use it from net/ipv6/netfilter/ip6_queue.c.
    - make ip6_addr_prefix() to generate prefix of given address and
      prefix length, instead of doing "ipv6_copy_addr() then
      ipv6_wash_prefix()."
   
Please change new name to ip6_route_me_harder().  When one
says "something me harder" is has amusing implications when
heard by most english speakers and I'd like to keep this :-)

I will apply this patch once you make the change.  Would you
like me to add it to 2.4.x as well?

We really need to revisit USAGI patch backlog.  I have and will apply
privacy extension 2.5.x patch you sent.  For all the others please
feel free to "patch bomb" me :-) Please indicate with each patch
whether the it is desired in 2.4.x as well.

If you wish to concentrate on ipv6 ipsec first, that is ok too. :-)
