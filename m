Hi Samir,
Apologies for the latency. Just caught up with the discussion.

This looks reasonable. Playing around with it will provide better
insight.

I think you meant recvmsg

This is not true for all socket domains. Example, not true for unix or
tipc etc. In any case, I think it should be feasible to do the copy
earlier for udp/tcp/icmp and make it optional to turn on this
(early-copy) feature.

I would rather have one unified interface instead of one from nfqueue
and another from your work. Besides, nfqueue works with a very limited
socket domains. It will be a lot easier to use the security hooks
instead.
I dont think it is wrong to replicate the nfqueue type approach for your
case.

Could you not just replicate nfqueu approach?

This is still a synchronous approach with some workaround. It may be
sufficient but you have other problems in cases you cant sleep in;

For async, something along the nfqueue approach or ipsec/xfrm ACQUIRE
approach where state is maintained in the kernel, you shoot the data to
user space and terminate the code path; later on, the data is
re-injected, you lookup the state and continue processing would do.
Given that someone already pointed out that you will have problems
with some code paths because you cant sleep, i believe an async approach
will solve at least that particular issue.

cheers,
jamal
