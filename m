I'm going to apply this to net-next-2.6, thanks!

I was going to suggest simply adding a port member to the
in_pktinfo struct, because at worst the user will see
a MSG_CTRUNC.

But I guess that is not worth the risk.

If you want to do the function pointer cleanup suggested
by David Stevens, please make that as a followon patch.

Thanks.
