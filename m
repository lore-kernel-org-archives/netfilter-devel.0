I asked you if you had multiple namespaces, because I was not sure
conntracking hash was global (shared by all namespaces), or local.

If it is local, then we have a bug, because nf_conntrack_cachep=20
is still shared.

Because of SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU constraint, we must use a distinct
cachep, or an object can be freed from a namespace and immediatly reuse=
d
into another namespace, without lookups being able to notice.
