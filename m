Yes, you are right. As far as I remember it was very hard to trigger
that critical moment, when the first packet triggered the insertion int=
o
the hash table. But the test and production systems showed this strange
behaviour, that no traffic was allowed to flow for exactly 600 seconds.

Yes.

=46eel free to change the verdict, IMHO it doesn't matter at all as lon=
g
as the hash table is in a consistent state. The higher protocol layers
will deal with the missing packet.

Under heavy load this can happen anyway I guess?
