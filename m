I am interested to see the numbers. I think this would be a great paper;
it is extremely tempting to spend time on it.

Yes - but my good friend Patrick is not saying that.
I dont want to turn on netfilter in order to get tc actions on ingress.
And i dont want to be slowed down because now the code path has become
longer. We are trying to prune the code path. If somehow you can work to
not affect performance then we can live well together.
