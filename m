So what seems to be happening is that this case in __ipv6_conntrack_in()
triggers:

        /* Conntrack helpers need the entire reassembled packet in the
         * POST_ROUTING hook. In case of unconfirmed connections NAT
         * might reassign a helper, so the entire packet is also
         * required.
         */
        ct = nf_ct_get(reasm, &ctinfo);
        if (ct != NULL && !nf_ct_is_untracked(ct)) {
                help = nfct_help(ct);
                if ((help && help->helper) || !nf_ct_is_confirmed(ct)) {
                        nf_conntrack_get_reasm(reasm);
                        NF_HOOK_THRESH(NFPROTO_IPV6, hooknum, reasm,
                                       (struct net_device *)in,
                                       (struct net_device *)out,        
                                       okfn, NF_IP6_PRI_CONNTRACK + 1);

Since this code is called while walking through the fragment chain, we have
extra references to the reassembled skb. So I think what we need to do is
to release the fragment chain before calling NF_HOOK_THRESH() and indicate
this to nf_ct_frag6_output() so it will stop processing the chain immediately.

I'll give it a try, will let you know when I have a patch for testing.
