Hi Jamal,

thanks for your help.

I just tried opening a simple tcp connection without any xfrm or other weird 
stuff. I just had one iptables rule in place:

-t raw -A OUTPUT -d 192.168.5.200 -j MARK --set-mark 99

192.168.5.200 is the other system I open the tcp connection from. So this 
should mark all response packets to the client.

But the moment __xfrm_lookup is called (this is where my debug printk sits), 
fl->mark is always 0.

By chance I changed the rule over to the mangle table:

-t mangle -A OUTPUT -d 192.168.5.200 -j MARK --set-mark 99

Now it works, the mark in the flow is 99!

So it seems this has nothing to do with xfrm, but that the MARK target has 
different effects when used in raw than in mangle. I was using raw because I 
had to set conntrack zones too and it was more conveniant to do both in one 
place.

Can one of the netfilter guys comment on this? Is using MARK in raw not fully 
supported or has known deficiencies?

Kind regards,

Gerd
