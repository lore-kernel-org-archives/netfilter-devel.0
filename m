The part that concerns me is that the reader lock used in a nested mann=
er on
same cpu may still be broken on -rt. Other than that it is just languag=
e
lawyering; violent agreement that the lock gets used multiple times by
same CPU. I never had the occasion to address this before
(and avoided such usage), but this legacy code exists and needs to
be dealt with.

[PATCH] netfilter: Ceci n'est pas une serrure r=C3=A9currente

I don't care. I don't care. Don't you get the point yet.

Because meaning comes from context, and my meaning comes from different
context. So we disagree on correct names.=20
