as long as the locking occurs in the same order :-)

Actually it's between userspaces that uses different netns
i.e. when starting a thread and exit a container (with different namespaces)
This bug would not have occured if a per netns mutex had been used.

>So, lets try with new mutex.

OK, I missed the reading of thread status, i.e. a sync_mutex is needed

There is no need for a lock(mutex) in ip_vs_sync_net_cleanup() before stoping threads,
because when it's called no user processes exits in that namespace.
