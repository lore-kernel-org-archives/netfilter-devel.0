I don't see why it is confusing. Plain text packets are visible before
encapsulation (and they have to be because we don't necessarily know
if packets will be encapsulated at the time the hooks are called in
case the policy lookup after NAT returns a policy), plain text packets
are visible after decapsulation. With different hooks we can't have
symetrical behaviour because of the case I mentioned above, and that
would be confusing IMO.

My patches don't change when and if packets will reach
ip_local_deliver_finish(), they just add a possibility for rerouting.
Currently the transforms are called from ip_local_deliver_finish() and
in transport mode the decapsulated packet continues its path in
ip_local_deliver_finish(), with my patches they will go through two
netfilter hooks and continue the exact same codepath, given that
they are not NATed to a foreign destination IP on their way.

Same goes for ip6_input_finish as for ip_local_deliver_finish(),
the packet would continue its path there anyway. Do you actually
mean ip6_rcv_finish()?

I'm not sure I understand. Do you propose to check if the packet was
mangled after the PRE_ROUTING hook (if it was not stolen or queued)
and if not return directly to ip6_input_finish()? Where would the
LOCAL_IN hook be called?

AFAICT statistics are not affected by my patches, except for the
iptables counters. The double parsing of extension headers is indeed
a problem I forgot about, it looks like we need to carry nhoff around
if it can't be derived from the packet.
