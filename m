	Yes, ipv6_addr_type has little price. May be only
DNAT and IPSec can complicate such caching.

	Yes, I checked every site that uses rt6i_gateway but
not with the perspective to use rt6_nexthop(). It seems
this is a rt6_nexthop() candidate.

	Yes. I found only one place more dangerous:
fib6_add_rt2node(). But I think its checks are still valid.
