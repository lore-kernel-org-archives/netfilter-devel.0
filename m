Some misunderstanding is going on here.

The *ref* annotation is used to teach modpost that this function (or data)
may reference functions (or data) which is annotated __init*.
And the *ref* annotation never caused the annotated code to be discarded.

This was true before the above mentioned patch - and it is still true.

Before the path ("Introduce new section reference ....") the __exit_refok
annotation moved functions to the section named ".exit.text.refok"
which was explicit part of .text (TEXT_TEXT in vmlinux).

So __exit_refok does exactly what it is intended to do:
It puts the function in a section so modpost does not warn about
references to __init or __exit sections.

As Jan points out there is only a single user left - so
this would be a good time to kill it. It is even documented
in init.h that this is a backward compatibility define.

The intention with Jan's patch is to move functions annotated
__net_exit to a discardable section in the core kernel.
Then at least __exit should be used - there is no logic
using __init for exit code.

I suggest to:
1) fix the patch to use __exit
2) fix up the bogus commit message

Then it should be OK - iff the assumption hold that the functions
can be discarded in the core kernel.
I have grepped a little and saw no uses where this did not hold true.
So based on this I assume the assumption is OK.
