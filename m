skb->sk is set for exmaple in xt_TPROXY that is before reassemly is
done, because reassembly is done after all the netfilter code pass the
skb through. I do not see how this can be changed in the way you are
suggesting.

I had very similar patch prepared. But I did not like it so I chose the
other way. I'm more or less okay with doing this this way though...
