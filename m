Secrets protecting hash tables should be rather strong.

prandom_u32() has two seeding points at boot-up. One is at late_initcall.
Thanks to parallel boot-up this gets executed fairly early. The other one is
when the RNG nonblocking pool is fully initialized. Only after this point we
can assume prandom_u32() returns truely random values. In between, only
get_random_bytes or net_get_random_once are safe for use.

To get the impression when prandom_u32 gets truely seeded, watch out
for the message "random: nonblocking pool is initialized" in dmesg. ;)

Hmm, some of them look like good candidates for net_get_random_once. I don't
see such a problem with draining entropy pool, especially as they don't run
that early and they don't request so many random bits.

Greetings,

  Hannes
