Thanks, It's a really odd case when you don't have enough memory to start the kernel
I think it's cured now, it doesn't trigger any dumps now.

Tested with and without CONFIG_NET_NS

Well, I don't think "[PATCH 2/2] ipvs: fix app registration in netns" is needed if the null check is there.
I have only used the NULL check (without ERR_PTR()  :-)  not the entire patch in my tests.

If you think it's needed it is OK for me.

Oops, cut & paste
