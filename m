Yes, but I think (2.6.34) there also needs to be a better way to expose
netns topology and visualize all the hashtables on a system - if you're
the admin you really want to be able to see all of them, not just for a
particular namespace you might be in, in addition to the perns views.

We already discussed 2.6.34, I'm only mentioning this "for the record".

Jon.
