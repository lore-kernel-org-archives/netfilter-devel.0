Well, there's another question which is not addressed by Bob Jenkins'
design docs:

Kernel code usually runs cache-cold, whereas Bob Jenkins did most of
his testing cache-hot in tight loops.  If you compile both lookup2 and
lookup3 with -Os and run them in a loop with a cache flush, how well
do they compare then?
