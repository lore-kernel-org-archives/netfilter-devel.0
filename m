As I mentioned in another email, this patch can't be used, it
breaks in mixed 32/64 bit environments.

I guess I'm a bit on the slow side but I didn't quite read the above text like 
that.
Anyway, this rule about not changing structs exported to userspace truly 
sucks, IMHO. If someone decides to compile her own kernel this person should 
not expect every userspace tool to keep working, again IMHO. Adding a new 
module to the kernel results in the user having to upgrade her tools, 
recompiling won't even do. Why on earth do you allow adding modules.
But I'm sure some nice volunteer will come along and downgrade that code 
fragment.
