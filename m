No.  Network namespaces in general can be cleaned up in any order.

In particular you should never ever expect to see the order
n,n-1,n-2,...,2,1.

It may make sense to special case init_net in the cleanup order
but I would really rather not.

Now init_net is special and really should never be cleaned up
for non-modular code.  So it almost makes sense to special
case init_net.

Does anyone know why Alexy decided to do this only for init_net?

My inclination is that Gao Feng is on the rigt path by just removing
the strange init_net special case and performing the work once
per module load, and once per module unload.

Thank you.

It is nice to see that we have exposed this mis-assumption.

I am inclined to leave the order of this list as is so that
other assumptions of network namespace unregistration order
are exposed.

Unless there is a truly good reason to perform magic on init_net.
