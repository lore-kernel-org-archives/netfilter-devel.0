I don't understand why we're writing such complicated code.

Oh I see why, it's because not every arch uses the generic SMP helpers
yet :-)

Because if they did universally, we could solve this problem so
simply, by merely sending a remote softirq to every online cpu.  Once
those all complete we have enough of a quiesce period, every cpu must
have exited any netfilter packet processing code path they were in.

And we could know they complete using an atomic counter or something.
