One of the issues that CLUSTERIP needed to do is to work with
locally-originated connections, i.e. every node within the cluster still
has to be able to open tcp connections to anywhere.

We currently catch this with connection tracking, which will assign all
reply packets to such outbound connections INVALID on all but the
originating node in the cluster.

Yes, I know, this sounds like a very strange setup.  Still it was one of
the requirements for it's implementation.
