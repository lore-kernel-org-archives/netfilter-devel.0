The pid may change after this for sure. What problems do you know
about it? What if we try to allocate the same PID in a new space
or return -EBUSY? This will be a good starting point. If we manage
to fix it later this will not break the API at all.

OK. The interface is good. I just don't want you to send it for an inclusion
until we decide what to do with waiting.

Poll is OK with me. As far as the notification is concerned - that's also
done in OpenVZ. If you are OK to wait for a week or two I can do it for net
namespaces.
