No, ip6_route_me_harder() only attaches a new route to the packet,
the packets contents are not changed.

No, what is happening is that radvd sends the packet with a specified
ifindex using IPV6_PKTINFO. The mangle table notices that the mark
changes and calls ip6_route_me_harder(), which performs a new route
lookup without taking the specified oif into account. It therefore
chooses the first of your two routes and sends the packet out eth1.
