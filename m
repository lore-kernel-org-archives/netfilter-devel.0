Fixing this requires some rather intrusive changes. We need
to perform a lookup on the unconfirmed list when a conntrack
is not found in the hash and use the one we find there, if any.
The entries on that list are not reference counted and there
are a lot of assumptions in the code that an unconfirmed conntrack
is exclusively associated with a single packet. This needs to
be audited and fixed, but it looks quite hard.
