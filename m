I realized this, I wrote this:

synchronize_sched_expedited() will not wait for CPU#0, because
migration_call()::case CPU_DEAD wakes up the requestors.

migration_call()
{
	...
	case CPU_DEAD:
	case CPU_DEAD_FROZEN:
		...
		/*
		 * No need to migrate the tasks: it was best-effort if
		 * they didn't take sched_hotcpu_mutex. Just wake up
		 * the requestors.
		 */
		spin_lock_irq(&rq->lock);
		while (!list_empty(&rq->migration_queue)) {
			struct migration_req *req;

			req = list_entry(rq->migration_queue.next,
					 struct migration_req, list);
			list_del_init(&req->list);
			spin_unlock_irq(&rq->lock);
			complete(&req->done);
			spin_lock_irq(&rq->lock);
		}
		spin_unlock_irq(&rq->lock);
		...
	...
}

My approach depend on the requestors are waked up at any case.
migration_call() does it for us but the coupling is largely
increased.
