This is the kind of direction I'm leaning towards as well.

The behavior of these middleboxes borders on unbelievable.  And there
comes a point where catering to these various busted boxes stops to
make sense.  At some point we have to say "sorry, someone has to get
that box fixed."

You can't reorder packets like that, on purpose, and not expect some
new, yet reasonable, TCP algorithm to fall flat on it's face.
