Not necessarily, rcu_access_pointer does not need it.

Yes.

Right, the hook_list needs to be checked vs. NULL again.

Alternatively of course just place rcu_read_lock above and replace
the acccess_pointer with hook_list = rcu_dereference().

Right.

Nowadays we zap entries that have a hook owner that we are
unregistering, this is also why we don't have owner refcounting
of the hooks anymore.  So this *should* be fine.

My fault.

These patches originate from a garbage pile of an old working
branch of mine and it never was in a shape where each patch
was building on its own, and it was also never checkpatch-clean.

I also never got around splitting it into smaller bites.
