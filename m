/me grabs some popcorn from tglx

It's really not that much of a discussion, Documentation/kobject.txt has
said this for years, it's as if no one even reads documentation
anymore...

If you embed a kobject into a structure, you have to use the kobject for
the reference counting of the structure, otherwise it's a bug.  If you
don't want to use a kobject to reference count the structure, don't
embed it into it, use a pointer.

Are "slabs" never freed in the slub allocator?  Surely someone should
have seen the huge "this kobject doesn't have a release function" error
message that the kernel should have spit out for it?

Just make the kobject "dynamic" instead of embedded in struct kmem_cache
and all will be fine.  I can't believe this code has been broken for
this long.
