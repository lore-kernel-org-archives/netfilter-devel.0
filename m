Only on Linux, and only because you look at locking from
the point of view of the magic variable "current" process
point of view.

But what happens when this side effect disappears?

In Documentation/ ?  online ?  Where is the definition? The only reference
I se is indirectly in DocBook/kernel-locking.tmpl.

The people complaining about naming never seem to be the ones providing
workable suggestions or patches.

Name it "dog's breath locking" for all I care. I am not bothering
with arguments over names; there is real work to do elsewhere.
