Ok, I get it.=20
Thanks Pablo.

Another question, Liping found the port style of sip, irc, and tftp was=
 different with ftp.
It should be use iterator "i" to generate name for them.
Then should I update the original patch or create another one to correc=
t it?

BTW, I am sorry about that. I didn't notice there are two port styles.

I'm refering to this specifically:

static int function(int parameter1, struct another_structure *blah,
                    int parameter2, unsigned int parameter3);
                    ^

It is just a comestic issue, but we consistently align function paramet=
ers to the initial parens.

As I said, I have just manually fixed this here, so no problem, just ke=
ep this in mind for the next time.

Another observation: You should bump patch version numbering in each re=
vision and keep some history on its evolution.

The area after the patch separator --- and before diff stats is good to=
 place volatile information that is only meaningful to the review proce=
ss, I mean something like this:

  subsystem: Patch title.

  Patch description...

  Signed-off-by: Lucas Skywalker <trotacielos@blackstar.org>
  ---
  v3: Address comments from Chebakia on possible backward compatibility
      issues.
  v2: New parameter to control something.
  v1: Initial patch.

Thanks.
