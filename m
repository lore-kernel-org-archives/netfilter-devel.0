This appears to be in the hlist_for_each_entry_safe iteration within
nf_ct_remove_expectations, iterating over the list of nf_conn_help(ers)
returned by nfct_help. I don't know what that code does (I have an idea
but only at a high level at this stage), though I'm poking a little here
to see if I can understand enough of netfilter to be useful. Feel free
to give me some pointers to help you guys debug this faster.

Jon.
