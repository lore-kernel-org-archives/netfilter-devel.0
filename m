Amen

We should not improve IPv4 support then, I see.

My customers use this old module, and upgrading to xt_cluster is not an
option.

Should we discuss this forever or fix it ?

In the end, people are forced to add useless iptables rule to DROP
INVALID packets before entering ipt_CLUSTERIP, after googling or
eventually asking to experts.

Last time this was discussed, this went nowhere :

http://www.spinics.net/lists/netfilter/msg48676.html

Come on guys, we can do it, dont be afraid.

A non rate limited printk() in kernel is forbidden, especially in
network stack.

Then, cluster match can be improved, I am sure you already have a patch
for it.
