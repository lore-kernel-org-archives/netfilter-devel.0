Ah, I see your point.  Yes, I did wonder about what would happen when
nf_conntrack_locks_all was set back to false.  But I didn't think about
it any further, because the relevant code wasn't in your patch.

You are right, this does need to be smp_load_acquire() after all.  
Perhaps the preceding comment should mention that it pairs with the 
smp_store_release() from an earlier invocation of 
nf_conntrack_all_unlock().

(Alternatively, you could make nf_conntrack_all_unlock() do a
lock+unlock on all the locks in the array, just like
nf_conntrack_all_lock().  But of course, that would be a lot less
efficient.)
