Yes, that's how I understoo Allesandro's efforts.  While I don't think
it's worth being that precise (and rather change the definition of what
is being accounted to 'number of packets/bytes recevived in this flow').

Yes, this is a race condition.  However, I don't this is not very likely
to occurr, since the accounting data is by default only sent to
userspace via ctnetlink once the connection tracking entry is deleted.

Yes, you can read it while the connection is still alive, but this will
not reset/update the counters, but rather give you a current snapshot.
If you send this to your accounting server, the accounting server has to
cope with the fact that this intermediate snapshot can be updated by
some later data.  It SHOULD not care whether this later data for the
same flow has bigger or smaller byte/packet counters. [and
it is very unlikely that the total will be lower, since then in the
timeframe [snapshot, terminations] more packets have to be dropped than
accepted.  Still, if this is documented with ctnetlink I'm perfectly
fine which such behaviour.

oh yes, I think somebody has written a similar iptables target, too. I'm
not sure whether there is a good solution for the 'unbill' feature.  Do
you have any thoughts/recommendations for this?

Totally agreed. =20

The reason for not delaying accounting update until qdisc has happened
is locking.  Then we would have to re-grab the conntrack write lock to
make the counter update... whrereas in my patch counter updates happen
while we are already under write lock for the timer/timeout update.

Also, if this 'unbill' feature gets into the kernel in some form, I
would definitely make it a CONFIG_ or sysctl... after all people could
be interested in the Rx side only...
