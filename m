Well, I'm ready to maintain the module my self.  I know we talked (during 
Netfilter Workshop) about putting the module into the Xtables-addons 
git-tree, because the project had stalled.

But things have changed! - I now have some people/developers interested in 
the project, thus I'm taking an active maintainer role instead.

My plan is to keep the module "compatible" with the Xtables-addon build 
system.  Thats why I make my module use your compat_* system from xt-a.
This way you can easier copy the module into you tree, if I fail to 
maintain the module...

I have looked at your improvements in the "mp2t" branch of you tree. I'll 
integrate those changes/improvement in my tree, and give you the author 
credits in my tree.

(ps. this email got delayed on my postponed email outbox, sorry.  Have 
already had some offlist discussions with Jan)

Cheers,
   Jesper Brouer
