	Ok, surely some patch between .24 and .25 caused this. Or it's
some bug that only "appeared" in .25 :)

	In fact, the frto patch helped, but not prevented the problem.
I mean, it seems that with the frto patch, the problem doesn't happen
frequently. And if I disable frto, the problem doesn't occur either.

	But, maybe, we could be talking about another bug, completely
unrelated to frto... I don't know. i'm just guessing ;). Anyway, we
talk about stalled connections ;)

	What I know is:

1) what you wrote is right: 2.6.24 is fine, 2.6.25 and 2.6.26 not

2) nmap -sS <server> seems to reset the connection (it's my workaround
until now ;). Maybe the ping probe help in some way? I don't know.

	I want to help you as much as I can. So, ask anything you need.

	Thanks!
