We don't have per application configurations, not even with these
patches...?
The configuration is still global/per netns?

Application level firewall makes me think of proxies.
What exactly are we talking about?
Can you provide examples?

We have static keys for nf hooks so there is no performance decrease if
no netfilter hooks are active.

HOWEVER, this discussion seems to hint at the opposite, namely that this
will turn into a mandatory or at least auto-enabled feature.

But regardless, I called it a sledgehammer not because of performance
concerns but because just to get this proposed socket matching facility we
now have to put hooks into all protocol handlers and commit to keeping them
there forever.

Also, some time ago Eric suggested to allow binding to tcp ports
from packet sockets to implement userspace-driven TCP stacks (i.e.
kernel would just queue raw frames for the given quadruple withput
caring about ordering etc).

If we allow this proposed change, we'd also have to extend that
with these hooks.

Next time someone mentions that we don't have application matching
but only sk/cgroup tests. Are we then going to consider doing task lookups?

Application not running -> different behaviour.  I'm sure thats obvious
to you, but I'm not sure if its obvious to users that their
'match on net clsid 42' won't work anymore when that service isn't running.
