I'm still spinning around this and I don't come with some easy
solution that doesn't break the existing semantics. One possibility
can be to drop the ct reference after leaving ingress, so the lookup
happens again in prerouting after the raw table to attach it again and
no ct is seen in the raw table but:

1) it's suboptimal in case users have rules using ct at ingress and in
   iptables.

2) the conntrack template infrastructure needs to be reworked/replaced
   by something more flexible to attach features to conntracks, so we
   can still attach features for conntrack entries that were created
   at ingress (so helpers / custom timeouts / notrack don't break).
