	Yes, only states are changed. What is missing is a
libipvs support to modify per-protocol timeouts because they
are not exported to /proc anymore. As the states have name,
may be we can implement timeout to be set as follows:

	ipvsadm --set-state-timeout -p TCP SYN 10

	Using 2 timeout tables just for secure_tcp is
complicated and with the above control it is not needed.
