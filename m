Well, the reason was to avoid unnecessary work doing refragmentation
unless really required. I know its rather complicated, but IPv6 has
always required treating fragments manually or using conntrack state.

I'm not objecting to changing this, but the patches as they are are
not the way to go. First, moving nfct_frag to struct sk_buff seems
like a real waste of space for this quite rare case. Also, we can't
just use the reassembled packet in ip6tables, when modifying it we
will still output the unchanged fragments. An last of all, we'll be
executing the rules on the reassembled packet multiple times, one
for each fragment.

So if someone wants to change this, simply *only* pass the reassembled
packet through the netfilter hooks and drop the fragments, as in IPv4.
