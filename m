Hans have (already) proposed this solution:

  if ((!skb->local_df && skb->len > mtu && !skb_is_gso(skb)) ||
      (IP6CB(skb)->frag_max_size && IP6CB(skb)->frag_max_size > mtu)) {

And I have tested it works.
But I'm not sure about, if we really need the "!skb->local_df" check ?


Thus, we should extend you patchset with a patch, that also address the
MTU checks in IPVS.
