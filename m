From: Florian Westphal <fw@strlen.de>

When skb is queued to userspace it leaves softirq/rcu protection.
skb->nfct (via conntrack extensions such as helper) could then reference
modules that no longer exist if the conntrack was not yet confirmed.

nf_ct_iterate_destroy() will set the DYING bit for unconfirmed
conntracks, we therefore solve this race as follows:

1. take the queue spinlock.
2. check if the conntrack is unconfirmed and has dying bit set.
   In this case, we must discard skb while we're still inside
   rcu read-side section.
3. If nf_ct_iterate_destroy() is called right after the packet is queued
   to userspace, it will be removed from the queue via
   nf_ct_iterate_destroy -> nf_queue_nf_hook_drop.

When userspace sends the verdict (nfnetlink takes rcu read lock), there
are two cases to consider:

1. nf_ct_iterate_destroy() was called while packet was out.
   In this case, skb will have been removed from the queue already
   and no reinject takes place as we won't find a matching entry for the
   packet id.

2. nf_ct_iterate_destroy() gets called right after verdict callback
   found and removed the skb from queue list.

   In this case, skb->nfct is marked as dying but it is still valid.
   The skb will be dropped either in nf_conntrack_confirm (we don't
   insert DYING conntracks into hash table) or when we try to queue
   the skb again, but either events don't occur before the rcu read lock
   is dropped.
