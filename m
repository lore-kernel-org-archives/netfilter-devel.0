This problem was also introduced by:

commit 0b5ccb2ee250136dd7385b1c7da28417d0d4d32d

    ipv6: reassembly: use seperate reassembly queues for conntrack and local delivery
    
    Currently the same reassembly queue might be used for packets reassembled
    by conntrack in different positions in the stack (PREROUTING/LOCAL_OUT),
    as well as local delivery. This can cause "packet jumps" when the fragment
    completing a reassembled packet is queued from a different position in the
    stack than the previous ones.
    
    Add a "user" identifier to the reassembly queue key to seperate the queues
    of each caller, similar to what we do for IPv4.
