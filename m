There you are adding a straw-man component into the mix. "Given two 
uplinks that only allow a certain source network address ", yes I agree, 
NAT is the sugar that makes these uplinks work. Irrelevant of load 
balancing.

In the same way the security != NAT, so too load balancing != NAT. As 
I'm sure you are all well aware.

Looking back at Ulrichs' original statement after reading yours it's 
clear he probably meant that (I hope so at least). The first reading 
though was that NAT by itself provided easy load balancing and DMZ.  I 
argue neither for or against validity of NAT. Just the Fuzziness 
Uncertainty and Doubt created by the particular statement was of a high 
amount.
