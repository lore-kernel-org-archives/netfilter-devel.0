I was mistaken.  In the mpath case there is no source address per
nexthop.

You still have one extra cache entry per input route now as the
keys of this lookup is not the same as the one for the packet.

True.  But this has only been the case since a year ago.  And I
agree with others that if you really need this, then SNAT is
better since your addresses are likely to be static and you
can use the mark directly in netfilter.
