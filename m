I hope, I answer that below.

On some of my small virtual machines (amd64) I even see this message while
login on the console (small iptables set also loaded before). In the mean
time prandom_u32() is still seeded with maybe 3 bits (I once measured it)
at the beginning and won't get a refresh until the nonblocking pool is
fully initialized. prandom_u32 will just iterate over its seed until it
is renewed whereas get_random_bytes does try to stretch (with help of the
twisted GFSR and SHA-1) the available entropy in case the nonblocking_pool
is limited, thus it is more probable to get better random results.

E.g. on an amd64 athlon x2 with two VMs:
[Mon Jan  6 13:35:40 2014] Initializing cgroup subsys cpuset
...
[Mon Jan  6 13:36:21 2014] random: nonblocking pool is initialized

I normally get the message while typing in the password on the prompt of the
serial console.

Single integers are not so much of a problem. E.g. one problem in
wireless code was, where get_random_bytes was called in a loop to fill
a structure, that did hurt: f7d8ad81ca8c44 ("mac80211: minstrels: spare
numerous useless calls to get_random_bytes").

I don't know if it is a real problem. Most of the time the initial seed
should be enough, but I guess get_random_bytes would still be a more
defensive choice. I would have used it. ;)
