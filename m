I'd suggest alternatives to resolve this problem:

1) Split xt_REDIRECT into ipt_REDIRECT and ip6t_REDIRECT, so we
restore the state of how this was back in 2012. The main motivation
behind that change was to reduce memory consumption by combining both
modules. In other modules, these combinations have been causing us
problems specifically when IPv6 symbols are used and it's not that
clean since IPv6 specific code remains there unused in the module even
if CONFIG_IPV6=n.

2) Merge nf_nat_redirect_ipv4 and nf_nat_redirect_ipv6 into
nf_nat_redirect, so we inconditionally build IPv6 redirect code, thus
xt_REDIRECT always finds the IPv6 symbol that needs even if it doesn't
use it.

3) Add #ifdef to xt_REDIRECT.c to make IPv6 specific code, this should
be a simple and small patch, but it results in #ifdef pollution.

Comments?

Thanks.
