I reviewed it earlier and agree last time that this patch is necessary.
Unfortunately forgot to ack before. :(

Acked-by: Hannes Frederic Sowa <hannes@stressinduktion.org>

In IPv4 as in IPv6 global addresses we have to expect packets coming
over multiple interfaces, it is only correct for local and multicast
scoped addresses. In IPv4 we don't really key the device index, only in
case of an vrf interface.

Thanks,
