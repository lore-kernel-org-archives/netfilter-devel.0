Sure, but my question was more general (more naive?) - what are the
hashs_to_skip?

sounds like i should be able to go read the genetlink code for an
answer, thanks.

Ok, but the way your loop is constructed, if snet_nl_list_fill_info()
returns 0 (success, presumably) you won't break.  Sounds like you want
to.
