So, just as an example, I would not object to the counter approach, as 
long as it really talks about the issues, and why it works (and as long 
that doesn't call the locks "recursive locks").

So if you are just nervous about rwlocks, then something like this might
work (needs testing, and other people to sanity-check it).

I left the commentary about "readers" and "writers", because in many
ways it's correct, and what the code actually does is very much to
emulate a reader-writer lock.  I put quotes around the uses in the
comments to high-light that it largely _acts_ as a reader-writer lock. 

Now, it would actually be a really _bad_ reader-writer lock in general, 
exactly because it's not very "atomic" (ie this would be a truly sucky and 
broken lock if we didn't have the strict per-cpu usage rules).

So it just so happens that the per-cpu'ness of the lock, together with the 
very limited way in which it is used, make that sucky implementation 
possible - and indeed possibly faster than the standard (and generic) 
kernel rwlock implementation.

So it's basically a special-case rwlock that happens to work due to the
specific rules. 

And exactly because it really wouldn't work in the absense of those
rules, those rules really do need to have big comments on them so that 
people don't then later forget about the limitations.

BTW: THIS IS TOTALLY UNTESTED.  I just cut-and-pasted the existing
rwlock version from one of the later patches, used the counting approach
from one of the earlier ones, and basically just added what I think
would be minimal required comments for this special case.  All of it was
written inside the mail reader, none of it has been compiled or tested
in any other way. 

Because it's exactly the "lock semantics awareness" that I think is so
important here (and that's why all the naming and commentary is so
critical). 

Btw, the "counter" could probably be just a single bit, since apparently
the nesting level is always supposed to be just one.  I made it
"unsigned char" just because sometimes spinlocks can be small, and it
seemed the simplest type.  But perhaps it would be better as an
"unsigned int", since some architectures potentially could do that
faster (eg old alphas).
