Did you see Dave's message? He said those that dump need to create
their own data structure so there is no point in proceeding with
any of this work within rhashtable.

So what?  They can switch over to lockless mode if they care.

The point is that for netfilter as it stands it makes no sense
to go lockless because its modus operandi is to hold a single
lock over everything, including walking/dumping.
