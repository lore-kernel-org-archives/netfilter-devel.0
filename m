That's pretty much where I gave up :)

Sure we can do that for now.

What I wanted to do if I ever get enough time to work on this is
to record the transport header length in a gso_hlen field so we
can fix this properly.

We currently have a useless gso_segs field that only has one or
two users that don't even need it.  We could easily get rid of it
and use that space for gso_hlen instead.

The gso_hlen field only needs to be filled in at the few spots
that generate GSO packets, i.e.,

1) TCP
2) Virt backends like tun.c
3) GRO
