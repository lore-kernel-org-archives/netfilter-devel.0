Not sure about that.
I already had concerns about the coexistance of my module and SELinux.
I have to take time for that.

yes, and better.
In fact, information is not dependant of the protocol at all.
What I mean is that we focus on network's syscalls, so for me, protocol
informations is let to the user for his/her decision.
When the module is catching bind(), we don't care if it's
TCP/DCCP/UDP/. What I care is to give the procotol information to the
user, to let him decide.

at security_socket_accept(), the user only accept the fact that the
application is able to go to sock->ops->accept(). That's the purpose of
this hook.

After, when packet are coming, we can catch them with
libnetfilter_queue, and deal with filtering packets.

here we agree. *but* in my module, the user don't judge before
sock->ops->accept(). He judges when packets are coming, throught the
libnetfilter_queue API, in userspace, and reinject packet if it's ok.

We are really trying to do the same thing, but I'm almost sure this can
be achieved with existing tool in fact, and put more "decision code" in
the userspace, and only keep a managing/detecting tool in the kernelspace.
