Good point -- you had in fact mentioned this earlier.

But there is another way.

Continue to use the migration kthreads, given that they already exist,
already are created and destroyed by CPU hotplug operations, and given
that they run as maximal priority.

My main concern with moving from get_online_cpus() to preempt_disable()
has been the thought that somehow, sometime, in some future release
of Linux, it will be possible for the migration threads to execute
on the wrong CPU, perhaps only occasionally and perhaps only for
very short time periods.  If this were to happen, there would be the
possibility that the grace period would end too soon, which would be
silently fatal.  My fingers simply refused to code something with this
potential vulnerability.

But it is easy to insert a check into migration_thread() to see if it
is running on the wrong CPU.  If it is, I can do a WARN_ONCE() and also
set a state variable to tell synchronize_sched_expedited() to invoke
sychronize_sched(), thus avoiding messing up RCU.  On the next call
to synchronize_sched_expedited(), it would again try relying on the
migration threads.

I am putting together yet another patch, but constructed along these
lines, and will let you know how it turns out.

							Thanx, Paul
