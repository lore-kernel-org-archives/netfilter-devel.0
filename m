This has already been explained in this thread; here it is again:

Basically, you have one big unintended gaping whole in your firewall, that 
could easily be exploited for DoS attacks at the least, unless you put in 
specific rules to limit this.

Plus, it's outrageously incorrect to accept invalid packets, just because 
your filtering infrastructure can only reject packets after they have been 
prerouted.
