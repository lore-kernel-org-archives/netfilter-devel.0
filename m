Not possible, but you could easily extend NFLOG to implement this 
feature if it's not possible to do what you need with the existing 
matches/targets. This NOTIF infrastructure is redundant and it looks 
like a subset of NFLOG.

There's a padding field in xt_NFLOG that is currently unused, it could 
be used for this.

Or we could add some 'count' match to store the number of packets that 
have matched a rule (although not sure if this is generic enough to be 
useful for others).

You can do that with libnetfilter_log to handle the log messages 
received and the minor change for xt_NFLOG that I proposed.
