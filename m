So far I don't see why we shouldn't just the LOCAL_IN hook as it
is and also haven't heard any reason against it. I'm fine with
not using netif_rx, but I don't see why we should complicate
things by introducing special semantics for decapsulated transport
mode packets.

IMO the view for netfilter should be as if we called netif_rx,
so on the input path decapsulated packets from the innermost
transport mode SA should go through PRE_ROUTING->LOCAL_IN
or possibly FORWARD in case of NAT.
