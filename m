There's no reason why they should overlap in the cb: it's 48 bytes big, 
so big enough to hold both struct br_input_skb_cb and struct 
inet_skb_parm. The original problem was introduced when BR_INPUT_SKB_CB 
was introduced (around Feb 27, 2010), so fixing BR_INPUT_SKB_CB seems 
most appropriate to me.
As for your other remark: as I've said before, if you don't like 
bridge-netfilter then don't compile it into your kernel.
