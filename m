I'll reiterate I think we should keep the refcount type just as it is, not for
safetys sake, but for readability and convienience.

Because the refcount currently only is used on add and delete operations
(implying it is only read in paths where its also modified), we need to
guarantee atomicity against multiple parallel writes.  We already have that
guarantee because every path in which we call
refcount_set/refcount_inc/refcount_dec_and_test occurs under the protection of
the list spin lock, and so from that standpoint we don't need the additional
guarantees offered by the refcount_t type.

However, if it were to be converted to an int type, we would have to replace the
refcount_dec_and_test call with this:
if (x == 0)
   warn_on_underflow
   return
x -= 1;
if (x == 0)
   preform_operations_to_free_list_entry

I find refcount_dec_and_test to be far easier to read and maintain, and you
still have to do all of this under the protection of a spin lock, to protect
against multiple writes.  And if you ever find that you are adding a pure read
side query of the refcount, you would need to hold the spin lock there as well,
instead of just using the available refcount_read api call

Yeah, you would save a few cycles if you didn't use an atomic type here, but
we're only talking about paths from user space making system calls executing
here (no high volume per packet receive paths or anything), and these paths have
already taken a few locks (the list lock, the task lock, etc), so eliminating
this one atomic isn't going to amount to anything.  Lets leave it as it is and
buy ourselves the extra code readability.
