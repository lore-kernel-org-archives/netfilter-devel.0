  I'm sure it hasn't. TProxy was never intended to be a "faster redirect",
or something like that. If you do not care about almost full transparent
proxying, you don't need TProxy at all.

  The TProxy patch can be used to make the proxy transparent from both
sides: the client sends the packets to the server's IP, and the server
sees packets coming from the client's IP. However, this needs user-space
support in the proxy itself. And Gianni Tedesco's latest TProxy support
patch for Squid is known to be broken...

  Completely true. This is _the_ way to go if you can set all clients to
use the proxy.

  Hmm... What a solution! :)

  As I wrote, the patch for Squid would need some fixes before actually
using it... Unfortunately I don't know enough about Squid to be able to
make those fixes.
