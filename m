Both the function and your example are backwards, and hence a lot harder 
to comprehend than they should be. It'd be much clearer as:

     if (nd->queue.next == &rq->queuelist)

which is a lot easier to read. Nobody should open-code a 'is this the 
first entry in the list' by asking 'is the previous link to my node the 
head', asking 'is the next entry in the list X' makes a lot more sense. 
I'm assuming this happened because the list_is_last was just copied and 
modified, instead of thinking about this for a second.

It's a balance, as we also should not make APIs out of everything. As I 
said, purely my opinion, but I think the is_last/is_first have jumped 
the shark.
