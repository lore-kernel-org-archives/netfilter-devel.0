Patrick, please follow the coding style conventions of the kernel,
these issues are important for long term sanity of the kernel tree.

It helps people who are looking at the netfilter code who perhaps
do not do so usually.  Do you really want to use a different style
and therefore make your code harder to read for them?  Really?

Your code being consistent with your code only is less important than
all of the networking looking the same.

Thank you.
