Yes, but if conntrack is there, we benefit from fragment reassembly if
you use skb_header_pointer.

No sorry. I was refering to normal IP header in one packet.

Yes, it is indeed needed.

OK, why are you using nf_ct_is_confirmed here? :-)

Welcome, let's see if we can get this into 3.3 since we cannot make it
for 3.2.

BTW, do you have some number of this running with and without
conntrack? It would be interesting to have.
