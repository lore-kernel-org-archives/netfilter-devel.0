It is in tunnel mode. LOCAL_IN is for all packets that are
locally delivered, independant of encryption. Using new
hooks for decrypted transport mode packets is inconsistent
IMO.

This isn't possible without adding completely new tables since
we can't add new chains to existing tables without breaking
userspace compatiblity. If we want existing functionality to
continue working we would need an "xfrm" version of the raw,
mangle, nat and filter table and need to change conntrack (and
possibly NAT) to use the new hooks. Rerouting after NAT (with IPv4)
won't work if we don't pass the packet through the stack again.
I think adding new hooks has too many drawbacks compared to simply
sending the decrypted packet through the stack again.
