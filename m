I'm neither of them but I strongly believe the patch is correct.  =20

The only question that Patrick raised during the discussion of this patch s=
ome
days ago is whether the __ipv6_addr_type() call would cause a runtime
dependency to thei ipv6 module.  This would be bad since loading the
xt_cluster.ko module should not pull in the IPv6 protocol module.

I have just verified that __ipv6_addr_type is provided by
net/ipv6/addrconf_core.c, which specifically states it contains functions
"needed by static components when full IPv6 support is not configured or
static".   This is confirmed by the makefile, which addes addrconf_core.o to
obj-y.

So from my point of view, I cannot see any problems.

Regards.
