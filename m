It was precisely that case. After a period of activity, the event is sent a long
time after the timeout. If the router does not manage a lot of flows, why not
trying to parse more entries instead of the default 1/64 of the table?
In fact, I don't understand why using GC_MAX_BUCKETS_DIV instead of using always
GC_MAX_BUCKETS whatever the size of the table is.

In fact, no ;-)
I really hesitate to expose the four values or just a subset. My goal was also
to get feedback. I can remove this one.

Even if it's not directly related to my problem, I think it's a good idea.
