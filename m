Some of the information in my last mail was wrong, i'll cut-and-paste 
the information entered into the netfilter
bugtracking system, maybe someone has a suggestion. The important part 
is the packets checksum turns out to
be right if the destination ip is replaced by the ip the mac belongs to, 
so the mac is correct.

--cut-n-paste--

With ip_conntrack loaded on the nfs server, client reads time out.
Clients start logging:

UDP: short packet: 192.168.0.1:0 0/120 to 192.168.0.23:0
UDP: short packet: 192.168.0.1:6439 28562/120 to 192.168.0.23:60558

tcpdump shows corrupted packets:
0:e0:7d:74:ab:cc 0:e0:7d:74:ab:cd 0800 1514: 192.168.0.1 > 192.168.0.223: (frag
42878:1480@4440+) (ttl 64, len 1500, bad cksum 29ff!)
0:e0:7d:74:ab:cc 0:e0:7d:74:ab:cd 0800 1514: 192.168.0.1 > 192.168.0.223: (frag
42879:1480@4440+) (ttl 64, len 1500, bad cksum 29fe!)

0:e0:7d:74:ab:cd is not the mac of 192.168.0.223 but 192.168.0.23. Both are
nfs-clients. If more nfs-clients show up more incorrect destination ips appear.
The packets checksum is correct if the (incorrect) destination ip is replaced by
the correct destination ip. Only single fragments have incorrect destination,
the remaining fragments of a packet are fine. Packets verified (checksum) in
ip_finish_output2 show no corruption.

Neighbour table of nfs server:
192.168.0.223 dev eth0 lladdr 00:e0:29:3c:c1:c9 nud reachable
192.168.0.23 dev eth0 lladdr 00:e0:7d:74:ab:cd nud reachable

The problem goes away as soon as ip_conntrack is unloaded. Another possibility
is to set the interface mtu to 1486 on the nfs server.

CPU: AMD-K6(tm) 3D processor, 256MB RAM
Kernel: 2.4.21-pre3 with few netfilter patches applied, problem also exists in
vanilla kernel, first noticed around 2.4.17
