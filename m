I know, but in the mean time I think its wrong :) The delivery
isn't reliable and what the admin is effectively expressing by
setting your sysctl is "I don't have any listeners besides the
synchronization daemon running". So it might as well use unicast.

So you're dropping the packet if you can't manage to synchronize.
Doesn't that defeat the entire purpose of synchronizing, which is
*increasing* reliability? :)
