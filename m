When I was thinking about pid namespaces and unshare last time.  The idea I came
to was we unshare of the pid namespace should only affect which pid namespace
your children are in.

I remember that do that there were a few cases where you would have to access
task->pid->pid_ns instead of task->nsproxy->pid_ns, but essentially it was pretty
simple.

Replacing struct pid is guaranteed to do all kinds of nasty things with
signal handling and the like, de_thread is nasty enough and you are talking
something worse.  So if we can change pid namespaces without changing
the pid I am for it.
