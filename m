Will try tomorrow MSK time.

Yep.

Yes, that could be an issue, but there are other skb_find_text() usages=
 and to=20
me they suggest that the intended behaviour is to stop search at 'to' o=
ffset.=20
In nf_conntrack_amanda.c, for example:

        start =3D skb_find_text(skb, dataoff, skb->len,
                              search[SEARCH_CONNECT].ts);
=2E..
        stop =3D skb_find_text(skb, start, skb->len,
                             search[SEARCH_NEWLINE].ts);
=2E..
        stop +=3D start;
=2E..
                off =3D skb_find_text(skb, start, stop, search[i].ts);

=46irst of all, nothing can ever match at skb->len, and second, it look=
s like=20
the third usage is also expecting to search from offset 'start' to offs=
et=20
'stop', not to 'stop + 1'.

em_text_match() in net/sched/em_text.c is also suspicious.

That would certainly make things consistent, but I'm not sure we want i=
t to be=20
consistent this way.
