I can see this may be frustrating to many. Now and then I actually got 
some positive feedback :-) Anyway, since I didn't have much sleep last 
night I'll be brief.
I'm fine with deprecating ebtables/bridge-nf. The code is over a decade 
old and development hasn't really picked up speed after I diverted my 
spare time to other things.
 From now on I'm no longer wasting my spare time on involvement in 
bridge-nf/ebtables. Anyone that wants to step up to take over the git 
repository (also contains arptables userspace app) can please contact me 
by private mail.

Best regards,
Bart
