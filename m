As everything may be exposed to denial of service attack..
I have some thoughts. snet is not a tool for securing the kernel code,
there is only one way to do so, it's to fix bug and to add code feature
to protect memory (cf grsecurity). snet is a tool to manage the
behaviour of users and applications, regarding network connections. 

the risk of deadlock is uneffective, as every sleeps occurs in process
context, so application can sleep without trouble.
there are 2 ways to go out of sleep :
 - receiving the verdict
 - timeouting

so deadlock are more "latency".
You win a admin tool, you loose some latency. I'm ok with that, as this
feature as its own public.

and of course, I'm not pretending to add a new idea. I'm sure some
mecanism like this already exist before 1987. I'm just the man who put
the code in order to be discuss on the lists, which was never been done
so far. 

there are some request from public distro:
