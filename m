Ok. I'd love to help out actually, given that I've been poking at this,
and it's quite fun. So please at least send me patches. The only other
thing I consider a priority issue at the moment for this is that writing
into /sys/module/nf_conntrack/parameters/hashsize on a running system
with multiple namespaces will cause the system to corrupt random memory
silently and fall over. That probably needs fixing until there is
per-namespace hashsize tracking, and this isn't a global tunable.

Also, some other things I think are required before 2.6.34:

*). Per namespace cacheing allocation (the cachep bits). We know it's
still possible for weirdness to happen in the SLAB cache here.
*). Per namespace hashsize tracking. Existing code corrupts hashtables
if the global size is changed when there is more than one netns
*). Per namespace expectations. This is for similar reasons to the need
for multiple hashtables, though I haven't poked at that.

I also think it is necessary to expose net namespace layout and
configuration via sysfs or some other interface, add a net->id parameter
(and may even an optional name), etc. Where does netns discussion
happen, on netdev I would presume?

> Jon, could you give this patch a try please?

Yup. Box is stable and boots multiple virtual machines as it did with
the quick hack from yesterday, so this has now fixed the problem.

Can you let me know if this is the final patch you want to post? If so,
we should get this into stable asap (and I have a couple of vendor
kernels that will need a version of this fix also).

Jon.
