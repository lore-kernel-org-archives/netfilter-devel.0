Hello!

There is no agreed-upon definition of spin_unlock_wait()'s semantics,
and it appears that all callers could do just as well with a lock/unlock
pair.  This series therefore removes spin_unlock_wait() and changes
its users to instead use a lock/unlock pair.  The commits are as follows,
in three groups:

1-7.	Change uses of spin_unlock_wait() and raw_spin_unlock_wait()
	to instead use a spin_lock/spin_unlock pair.  These may be
	applied in any order, but must be applied before any later
	commits in this series.  The commit logs state why I believe
	that these commits won't noticeably degrade performance.

8.	Remove core-kernel definitions for spin_unlock_wait() and
	raw_spin_unlock_wait().

9-26.	Remove arch-specific definitions of arch_spin_unlock_wait().

Thoughts?

							Thanx, Paul
