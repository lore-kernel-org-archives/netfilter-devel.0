Hi Phil,

On Tue, Aug 01, 2006 at 11:46:55AM -0700, Phil Oester told us:

if I understood Balazs correctly, one of the things he wanted to
avoid is addition/deletion of iptables rules on every pppX interface
up/down as this would require the complete chain (say, INPUT or
OUTPUT) to be "downloaded" to userspace, modified and then again
"uploaded" to the kernel. At least until iptables redesign to
allow replacement/insertion/deletion of single rules is completed
which if started at all will take quite some more time :-)
