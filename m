	Looks good to me but I see two places that can benefit
from such check:

- in ip_vs_genl_new_daemon() if we do not want to create IPv6 sockets
for the sync protocol in make_send_sock() and make_receive_sock().
Not sure if this can lead to crashes.

- in ip_vs_proc_sync_conn() if we do not want backup server to accept 
IPv6 conns because they may be created even when dests are missing.
We may use retc = 10 there. Not fatal but may eat memory for
conns that will not be used.

Regards
