I tested the patch and I ran into a problem in this place in 
ip6_expire_frag_queue():

>  	net = container_of(fq->q.net, struct net, ipv6.frags);

For frag queues coming from IPv6 conntrack, fq->q.net points to 
nf_init_frags which is not embedded into struct net so that the 
following device lookup leads to reading from an invalid address.
The same problem has been discussed on the page linked above.

I didn't test with current net-next source but as far as I can tell, 
this hasn't changed. Did I miss something?
