Indeed so. But you did not invent any new interface. You are reusing
files, which can be protected by DAC modes, or LSMs doing
funky-stuff. xt_{condition,recent,..} already implement file modes,
but does it check for it? Well no, because fs/namei.c does it for
them. As for LSMs, well, I hope they do cater for testing for
capability bits.

Certainly not. An administrator may create a condition rule and thus
procfs entry, but the rule may be sufficiently safe and/or integrated
that a subordinate may be given permission to control things in a
limited fashion on a per-need basis. One I use personally is

	-A FORWARD -m condition --condition windows -s
	192.168.100.0/25 -i eth1 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
	-P FORWARD DROP

	chown jengelh /proc/net/nf_condition/windows;

The presence of such rule would indicate that the administrator
generally allows Windows machines out; but personal paranoia defaults
to rejecting that unless explicitly enabled. (Gives the reassurance
that they won't succeed talking home unless Internet connectivity is
explicitly needed by the user.)
