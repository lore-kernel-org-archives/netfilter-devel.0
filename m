	At first look patch is ok. But I'm not sure
for the changes in ip_vs_xmit.c. Can you explain in
2-3 lines, when can we see different netns? Is it when
packet is forwarded to output device and it is part from
another netns?

	I'm asking because these __ip_vs_get_out_rt*
calls in ip_vs_xmit.c can reroute packet to another
device...

	Also, skb_sknet is another candidate for removal.
But I can take care about it after your changes are
pushed...

Regards
