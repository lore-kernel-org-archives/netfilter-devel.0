so ip6tables allocates about 128 Kbytes of ram in order to get rules fr=
om kernel.

This is a big problem yes, since "iptables|ip6tables" -L needs to alloc=
ate kernel memory
to perform the momentary swap.

On x86, this is potentially a problem if vmalloc space is exhausted or =
fragmented,
(or lowmem exhausted) and/or many cpus are online/possible.

Graham, could you please give us :

# cat /proc/vmallocinfo
# cat /proc/meminfo

I wonder if your machine is in a state where even an "ip6tables -A ..."=
 would fail anyway
since it should allocate same amount of memory than "ip6tables -L "


This could probably be solved using a single "table" containing rules o=
nly, that could
be shared for every cpus. Only counters should be percpu. This should s=
ave a lot of ram,
over previous situation (2.6.29 or current one)

(current scheme is to allocate a copy of all rules logic *and* counters=
 per cpu)

Then if we want to be sure "iptables -L" cannot fail, we should reserve=
 this extra space
at load time (iptables -{A|I}", instead.

Other possibility is to use a percpu seqlock as Stephen did in one of h=
is patch, and not swap tables
when doing "iptables -L".
This would slowdown fast path a litle bit (one spinlock/spinunlock) per=
 ipt_do_table() call.=20
