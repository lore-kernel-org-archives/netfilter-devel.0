Yes, i think you missed my point ;->=20
You guys are doing a great job at coming up with some good packet
classification algorithm(s). I wanna encourage you to continue doing
that.=20
OTOH, I have spent a lot of time thinking and coming up with a good
architecture for the action part (that follows classification). So it
will be a shame if you miss that because you happened to see one
good thing in the old code.
Putting the two together will result in some good things. You trying to
redo what i am doing will mean you are always a few steps behind[1]. Now
if you can do it better than what i have, then you can convert me=20
too - thats the way opensource works.=20

>=20

Lets work together instead of you trying to get nice ideas from
my new code. This way you benefit from any evolution i have; and i have
lots coming down.
You must switch to making your code tc filter capable to do this.

Probably true; but no point in making the limits when you dont have to.

I dont understand why you even have this byte to encode an action.
Look at my code.

>=20

Anything that requires "connection setup" to dynamically add rules is a
candidate. Think Voip SIP Proxy server for example which will insert
rules; think any authentication schemes that are needed before
installing rules, think tcp-splicing etc.

>=20

I think thats a design issue. For example while u32 classifier may not
process as fast as you (lookups would take longer relatively ) - its
insertion time is independent of the complexity of the rules.
Lakshman (sp?) had a good paper on the tradeoffs between memory space
used, lookup times and insertion times (there was another variable) and
i think he may have proved you cant have all of them work well at the
same time.

So if you add rule #50000 while there are already 49999 existing
it will take over an hour to install in the worst case, did i understand
this correctly?

>=20

Ok, so i didnt understand your table above then. 1s is very bad;
actually i shouldnt say that since i dont have numbers infront of me of
what is considered good. I will look this up

Which is fine. I would say for something like firewalling you have a
desirable feature of very optimized lookups.

That sounds more like still a user space problem ;->
I saw in your paper briefly that you have infact a checker for something
like this. That checker should run outside the kernel in my opinion.
The value in putting the commit in the kernel maybe for say making sure
you get the memory allocation you want etc before installing. But even
this is not a strong arguement.=20

>=20

So i would suggest that you look at the Lakshman paper for starters.
In my view the most important issues in priority order are:
lookup speed regardless of table size, insert/delete rate regardless of
table size, Capacity (should be able to go to the hundreds of thousands
of flows), memory use for storage purposes - although i dont really care
very much about these since memory is cheap these days.

I am sorry i confused you with them;-> I suppose you are both from .dk.

cheers,

[1]I briefly looked at your paper and it seems the only action you had
initially was DENY or ACCEPT.
Looking at your code you now have an action dispatcher that seems
to be exactly like the old one i have (you havent implemented code
around it but you have the hooks in place). This is why i made the
comment.=20
