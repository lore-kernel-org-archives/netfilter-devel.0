True. The practical difference is that it doesn't require a dedicated
process which is a big improvement operationally.

This is strictly different.  It may require a bit of extra support from
checkpoint/restart because it introduces some more user visible objects
but the names themselves are nothing special.  The name that userspace
sees and deals with is the name of the mount point.  No new namespaces
are required.
