I agree with you. I'd like to finish see something usable. On the other 
hand, there's no need to rush anyway.

Actually I wanted to contact Harald after this friday, once I'm done 
with my exams. I'd like to merge my work with his libqsearch hackings 
that were about to be finished.

Indeed, I think that we must share that code.

An infrastructure based on libqsearch let us have different algorithms, 
so we could use whatever algorithm. This won't be a problem.

I've been working on this, I'll pass you what I have as soon as I get 
time to review it again.

Those look fine for me. Actually I also need more than a true of false, 
a pointer to where a matching happens. This is a requirement for 
conntrack helpers.

Sure that you can improve current way of doing things :)

Harald,any thoughts?
