if it's not too late.
snet_nl_list(), in snet_netlink.c, is defined as a dumpit() genetlink
operation. A dumpit() operations is called when NLM_DUMP message flag is
set.

the genetlink dumpit() operation receives, as a argument, a
pre-allocated sk_buff buffer, so the purpose of snet_nl_list() is to
fill this buffer. snet_nl_list() is calling snet_event_fill_info() for
this job.

as long as snet_event_fill_info() is not returning 0, it means that it
fills data in the sk_buff, and the dumpit() operations is called again.

the behaviour of sending event list informations is to send a netlink
message by event - remember a event is [syscall, protocol]. so we are
iterate other the hashtable snet_evh:

  [0]               -> list_head: [sys0, proto1], [sys1, proto1]
  [1]               -> list_head: .. 
  [2]               -> list_head: ..
  ...
  [snet_evh_size-1] -> list_head: ..

in order to fill each the pre-allocated sk_buff.

so at each time the snet_event_fill_info() is called again, because of
returning values different from 0, we need to skip previous events which
were already filled in the buffer.
this is the purpose of 

	unsigned hashs_to_skip = cb->args[0];
	unsigned events_to_skip = cb->args[1];

to get the last event filled, and the purpose of :

        cb->args[0] = i;
        cb->args[1] = n;

to store the last event filled, at each call of dumpit()

at this point you may understand the purpose to skip the previous values
in the hashtables, and after the events values at each list.

No I don't, if it returns 0, we proceed the next event in the current
list.
once the list is empty, we proceed the next hashtable entry.
once the index running other the hashtable is egal to the hashtable size,
it's done.
