In this case, we don't end up with two rules, we actually get one
single hashlimit rule, given the sequence you provide.

        $ iptables-save > save.txt
        ... edit save.txt
        $ iptables-restore < save.txt

We discussed this in netdev0.1, and I think we agreed on adding a new
option, something like --hashlimit-update that would force an update
to the existing hashlimit internal state (that is identified by the
hashlimit name).

I think the problem here is that you may want to update the internal
state of an existing hashlimit object, and currently this is not
actually happening.

With the explicit --hashlimit-update flag, from the kernel we really
know that the user wants an update.

Let me know, thanks.
