I think we're going in circles a bit. :( You are right in saying that
currently, there's a central spinlock, which is worked on to get rid
of, you've seen the patch on the list floating around already. Single
CPU, artificial micro-benchmark, which were done show that you see on
your machine ~613Kpps to ~545Kpps, others have seen it more amplified
as 22.4Mpps to 18.0Mpps drop from __netif_receive_skb_core() up to an
empty dummy u32_classify() rule, which has already been acknowledged
that this gap needs to be improved. Lets call it unfounded then. I
think we wouldn't even have this discussion if we wouldn't try brute
forcing both worlds behind this single static key, or, have both
invoked from within the same layer/list.

Cheers,
Daniel
