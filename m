I am gradually working my way through the netfilter stack passing struct
down into the netfilter hooks and from the netfilter hooks and from
there down into the functions that actually care.  This removes the need
for netfilter functions to guess how to figure out how to compute which
network namespace they are in and instead provides a simple and reliable
method to do so.

The cleanups stand on their own but this is part of a larger effort
to have routes with an output device that is not in the current network
namespace.

The IPVS code has been a bit more of a challenge than most.  Just
passing struct net through to where it is needed did not feel clean
to me.  The practical issue is that the ipvs code in most places
actually wants struct netns_ipvs and not struct net.

So as part of this process I have turned the relationship between struct
net and the structs netns_ipvs, ip_vs_conn_param, ip_vs_conn, and
ip_vs_service inside out.  I have modified the ipvs functions to take a
struct netns_ipvs not a struct net.  The net is code with fewer
conversions from one type of structure to another.  I did wind up adding
a struct netns_ipvs parameter to quite a few functions that did not have
it before so I could pass the structure down from the netfilter hooks to
where it is actually needed to avoid guessing.

I have broken up the work in a bunch of small patches so there is at
least a chance and reviewing that each step I took is correct.  The
series compiles at each step so bisecting it should not be a problem
if something weird comes up.

The first two changes in this series are actually bug fixes.  The first
is a compile fix for a bug in sctp that came in, in the last round of
ipvs changes merged into nf-next.  The second fixes an older bug where
in pathological circumstances the wrong network namespace could be used
when a proc file is written to.

The rest of the patchset is a bunch of boring changes getting pushing
struct netns_ipvs (and by extension ipvs->net) where it needs to be.
Either by replacing struct net pointers or adding new struct netns_ipvs
pointers.  With a handful of other minor cleanups (like removing skb_net).

The changes are also available against nf-next at:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiederm/net-next.git master

My entire pending set of changes for those who want to look ahead is at:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiederm/net-next.git for-testing
