Quite frankly, that is ridiculous. I realize we turn in circles
in this discussion, so we will provide the numbers. Give us a test
case if you want, something you think is hard.

Agreed.

*Everything* except the purely passive ones as the policer will crash.
Everything. Its well known. No point in repeating it.

I stopped caring about TC a long time ago, basically when actions were
merged over my head, despite me being the only person actually taking
care of TC. You might remember, I spent multiple months cleaning up the
action mess when it was merged, and that was only the *really* bad bugs.
Magic numbers in the APIs, lists limited to more magic numbers etc,
I didn't care. Today I do not think its about individual problems anymore,
the entire thing is broken. Egress has some shared problems with ingress,
such as horrible userspace code, horrible error reporting, no way to use it
even for me without looking at both TC and kernel code as the same time, but
ingress is worse in the sense that the supermajority of it will actually
crash in very likely cases, and its not about ipt, its everything touching
a packet in the presence of a tap, like 2/3 of all actions. The qdiscs are
mostly (except integration of classifiers) fine, everything else is crap.

The abstraction is *wrong*. There is no queueing, hence using a qdisc
is the wrong abstraction. Why are we arguing about that? Its a
mechanism to invoke classifiers and actions. What is the qdisc actually
used for? It certainly doesn't queue anything, the only thing it's
doing is imposing the worst locking imaginable on the entire path.

If that's not enough, look at the actions. I mean, you're not classifying
for the sake of it, there are not even classes on ingress, its purely
done for the actions. And they are, as stated, almost completely
broken. We can do policing. That actually works. Maybe one or two more.
Except policing, none of those is even remotely related to QoS.
So let me ask again, in what sense is the abstraction actually right?

Quite frankly, talking about netfilter at all is so wrong that there
isn't even a possibility to respond. Netfilter is a mechanism - a hook
to receive a packet. And even that kicks your single threaded ingress
qdiscs ass every packet of the day. What we're talking about are the
things built on top. There's no question we also win on hardware that's
not 1975 there, because people are actually using it.
