Hi Pablo,

Testing out your patch:

1) With no NAT in place, the clash resolution happens, with no side
effects.  No EPERM errors are seen.

2) With ip(6)table_nat loaded, the clash resolution fails and I get
some EPERM errors from sendmsg(), same as before 71d8c47fc653.

Turns out that even though I have no NAT rules in my iptables config,
the system also had firewalld active and that caused the modules to be
loaded.

So the bottom line is that the patch looks good to me..

Thanks,
Marc
