For example i may want to add a tc rule to a group of interfaces.
tc BNF roughly looks like:
tc <object> <operation> <target>

Where targe is := <dev devname>
It may be useful to extend "target" to include alternatively a group of
devices.
The way i would see that done is to add a little wrapper to tc to first
ask the kernel for a list of interfaces and then invoke each with the
equivalent of current syntax.
Did that make sense?

I understand - but i would rather do the iteration in the kernel than in
user space and save myself a gazillion netlink messages.

Same lazyperson use cases as above; in one case i may want to set a rule
to group = {eth0, eth1, eth10} and in another {eth0,eth5}. I realize
this may be more involved something clever for an implementation (eg
using a bitmap instead of a straight int) - so if it not a simple thing,
just defer it to some later time.

Ok, now that you are asking, heres another one feature request for
you;-> It would be nice if i can set a group based on a regular
expression of a devices name; eg "ppp*". Use case for this, off top of
my head (without looking at your syntax):

ip set group 10 ppp*

And equivalent to "ifconfig ppp*" so i dont list 10K interfaces
ip list group 10 or pass any 5K messages to user space

cheers,
jamal
