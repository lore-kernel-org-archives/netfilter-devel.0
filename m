Pulled.

Two suggested improvements:

1) The HMARK hash is quite expensive, because it uses a modulus.

   Consider adjusting it to use the usual trick:

	((u64)(HASH_VAL * HASH_SIZE)) >> 32

   so that this can be a multiply instead of a modulus.

2) XT_HASHLIMIT_MAX is cumbersome.

   The canonical way to validate if the set bits are in	a
   valid range is to have a "_ALL" macro, and test:

	if (val & ~XT_HASHLIMIT_ALL)
		goto err;

   or similar.

Thanks.
