pt_prev will be always NULL if we enter the netfilter ingress hook, so
no need to store it.

For security applications, I guess they will be happy to get pretty
much everything that they can inspect.

I'll come back with numbers and more feedback anyway.

I'll explore this, this seems like a good alternative if performance
becomes a real issue.

Thanks.
