Hi,

The mail below details what appears to be a bug in IPVS.
Thanks to Fabien Duch=EAne for finding it and Joseph Mack for bringing
it to my attention.

The bug seems to be caused by the use of union nf_inet_addr in
the fwmark case. To start, this is what the union looks like:

union nf_inet_addr {
	__u32		all[4];
	__be32		ip;
	__be32		ip6[4];
	struct in_addr	in;
	struct in6_addr	in6;
};

So it has some 32bit values, and some 128 bit values. And is
usually used to store either an IPv6 address or an IPv6 address.
Usually we know which and the functions ip_vs_addr_copy() and
ip_vs_addr_equal(), which are shown below, work quite well.

The problem arrives when a fwmark is used to identify packets.
These could be IPv4 packets or IPv6 packets. Regardless, what
the code currently does is to store the 32bit fwmark in .all[3]
and 0 in the other 3 octets of .all.

In the IPv6 case, this should be fine. When .ip6 is compared
with another .ip6, a 128 bit compare will occur. And this should accura=
tely
compare fwmark values stored in .all as described above.

However, this scheme appears to break down in the IPv4 case. This is
because only .ip is used in comparison and it maps to the first octet o=
f
all, which is always set to 0 in the current scheme.

A simple fix that comes to mind is to just store the fwmark in
the first octet of .all, and set the other octets to zero.
But is .ip always going to be the same as .all[0]?

Is a different approach required? For example, one where we know to com=
pare
=2Eall or perhaps a single octet of .all in the case where fmarks are u=
sed.
This particular change should be easy enough. I believe that fwmarks ar=
e
only used in this way twice, both inside ip_vs_schedule(). But
ip_vs_addr_equal() is more generic, so I'd prefer only to mangle it if
needed.

Hi Fabien,

that looks like a bug in the IPv4 to me too. If so, it would have been
introduced when the IPv6 code was added to LVS, which was fairly recent=
ly.

It seems to me that it should be easy enough to fix by changing
fwmark in ip_vs_sched_persist() from:

union nf_inet_addr fwmark =3D {
	.all =3D { 0, 0, 0, htonl(svc->fwmark) }
};

to:

union nf_inet_addr fwmark =3D {
	.all =3D { htonl(svc->fwmark), 0, 0, 0 }
};

Assuming that this would result in fwmark->ip being set to
htonl(svc->fwmark), which is relevant if svc->af is AF_INET - that is,
for IPv4. IPv6 should work fine in both cases, as all 4 octets of
all will be tested - which would have presumably been the focus
of the IPv6 work that changed this code.

This assums that the ip element of union nf_inet_addr always correspond=
s
to the first octet of all.

An alternate idea would be to change the af value used for fwmarks,
but this seems to be even less clean than the current (slightly broken)
technique of using nf_inet_addr for IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, or fwmarks.
