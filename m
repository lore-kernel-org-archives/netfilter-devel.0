Folks,

Could whoever that made the versioning changes in iptables please
contact me?
I am CCing netdev because netfilter-devel seems to bounce my emails.

I need to punish him/her/them by having them look at my
tc code to make sure that i didnt miss some trick they used 
(I just found out how the target name was being abused to carry
versions;->). In the future please please remember there are other
users of these goods other than iptables.

I am willing to say "works only with iptables >= 1.3.1"  and make
sure tc pukes on lower versions. It would be better if i could say
"ok, user space is 1.2.1 which doesnt have versioning support - heres
what i need to do"

Kernel/userspace mismatch otoh may be a problem even if i decice in user
space i am gonna stick with iptables that has the versioning feature.
How do i detect that a kernel which has iptables support also has
versioning feature?

cheers,
jamal
