Hm. Do you have any suggestion in countering a case whereby a user
does -I OUTPUT -j TEE without conntrack?

Perhaps making nesting a feature that requires conntrack, such that the 
non-CT case can't loop?

I take it you mean

 nf_reset(skb)
 skb->mark = 0;
 skb_init_secmark(nskb);

Or should we be using skb_alloc and copying the data portion over, like 
ipt_REJECT does since v2.6.24-2931-g9ba99b0?
