Hi David,

The following patches provide two fixes:

* One to get the timeout special parameter for the SET target back working
  (this was introduced while trying to fix another bug in 3.4) from
  Jozsef Kadlecsik.

* One crash fix if containers and nf_conntrack are used reported by Hans
  Schillstrom by myself.

You can pull these fixes from:

git://1984.lsi.us.es/nf master

Thanks.

little notice: I forgot to add my Signed-off-by while manually applying
Jozsef's patch, sorry. It was a bit too late to fix, I already pushed out
to my master branch.
