Hi Pablo,

your patch is a bit different, as you do the message length
calculation on each packet.  Instead I do it once at compile time for
the proto independant part and then later for each protocol helper at
the time it is registered.  At unload time the helper is replaced by
the generic one (which implies =0 always).

Cheers,
