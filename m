We can merge those two, but you'll have to handle dependencies with
IPv6 core via ifdefs and Kconfig to avoid problems.

AH is not the last header, so we still have to use ipv6_find_hdr() to
find the good header instead of par->thoff. Note that the ip6_tables
sets par->thoff to the last IPv6 extension header.

This rises some concerns regarding your ipcomp, I think that if you
use this with ah and esp, the ordering of the headers is
ah+ipcomp+esp, right? In that case, you need to use ipv6_find_hdr()
since par->thoff would point to the esp header.
