Yes, I seem to remember glibc doing something like

 if ((addr & 0x03) != 0) {
     // process single bytes (increment addr as you go)
     // until addr & 0x03 == 0.
 }

 /* optimized loop here. also increases addr */

 if ((addr & 0x03) != 0)
     // still bytes left after loop - process on a per-byte basis

Is the cost of testing for non-4-divisibility expensive enough
to warrant not usnig memcmp?

Irrespective of all that, I think putting the interface comparison
code should be agglomerated in a function/header so that it is
replicated across iptables, ip6tables, ebtables, arptables, etc.
