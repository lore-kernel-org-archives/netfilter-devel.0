	Ok, there it is:

http://www.abusar.org/htb/dump-normal.log
=09
	Just the port 995... I checked email, then received a message,
checked again, just the normal behaviour.

	Ok :) And you're right, because if I disable frto and htb *and*
the problem has gone, there's a huge chance to be something related to
kernel. Or a mix of kernel and user space problem which happens just
when frto and/or htb are used.

	Ok. For example:

1) the connection is normal, then suddenly it stalls. I cannot receive
mail, nor download nntp messages, nor access ftp etc.

2) I do on my client machine a "nmap -sS server" and...

3) ...imediatelly the connection is not stalled anymore.

	Now I remembered one thing and I'd like to make a question (I
hope it isn't a stupid question): dynticks (tickless) were implemented
for x86-64 in 2.6.24 kernel and I started to use dynticks in 2.6.24. Co=
uld=20
it be affecting the server behaviour? I use dynticks (enabled) on all
my machines, but does it make sense to use in a server environment?
Could the dynticks cause this? Until now, I don't think so, but... who
knows?

	I tracked the 995 port, because I have problems reading email
pro pop3s (995). Should I do it different with tcpdump?=20

	Ok. It seems a complex issue. You're right. I need more
patience ;)

	Hmm interesting.

	Yes, I have login_max_processes_count =3D 128 (the default) and I
have just a few users (just 10 users), so I think it's not the problem.
