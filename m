Sorry for ignoring this for so long. I really don't have much of an
opinion on this except for what I said before:

- I would prefer a mechanism built on u32 if possible

- I want to hear at least one person speaking in favour of inclusion
   since I don't have much of an opinion of my own, but am somewhat
   doubtful how useful this is

I guess you could call Paul's "cool stuff" that, but please resend
once more to netfilter-devel :) Anyone who thinks this is useful
please speak up.
