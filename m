Hi Pablo,

this changest includes the following changes since the v3.2 series
which was most recently posted as "[GIT PULL nf-next-2.6] ipvs namespaces".

* Remove several hunks that only make whitespace changes
* Add Acked-by: Julian Anastasov <ja@ssi.bg>
  (It was an omission from v3.2)
* Fix merge conflicts

There are two changes that produce conflicts
* In the current net-next-2.6 tree but absent from the current nf-next-2.6 tree
  there is "workqueue: convert
  cancel_rearming_delayed_work[queue]() users to cancel_delayed_work_sync()"
* And in the current nf-next-2.6 tree  but absent from the current
  net-next-2.6 tree there is "net: use the macros defined for the members
  of flowi"

In order to create this series I merged net-next-2.6 into nf-next-2.6.
The result is at
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/horms/lvs-test-2.6 ipvs-netns3.3

However, I guess that you have already done your own merge and simply
pulling the branch above will create a bit of a mess. Please let me know
if you have a tree/branch that I should use as a base for a pull request.
