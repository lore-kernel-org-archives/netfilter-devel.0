The reason I put that in is because the size of that table becomes
more relevant/important if you decide to use the weights in the manner
the patch lets you. It would be conceivable that someone might need to
increase the size of that table to accommodate their configuration, so
I thought it would be handy to be able to do that through the regular
configuration system instead of editing the source.
