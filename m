That was in fact my first proposal, see the comment header in current
mainline for spin_unlock_wait() in include/linux/spinlock.h.  But Linus
quite rightly pointed out that if spin_unlock_wait() was to be defined in
this way, we should get rid of spin_unlock_wait() entirely, especially
given that there are not very many calls to spin_unlock_wait() and
also given that none of them are particularly performance critical.
Hence the current patch set, which does just that.

Indeed!  As Oleg Nesterov pointed out, a spin_lock()/spin_unlock() pair
is sort of like synchronize_rcu() for a given lock, where that lock's
critical sections play the role of RCU read-side critical sections.
So anything before the pair is visible to later critical sections, and
anything in prior critical sections is visible to anything after the pair.
But again, as Linus pointed out, if we are going to have these semantics,
just do spin_lock() immediately followed by spin_unlock().

If you want the full semantics of a spin_lock()/spin_unlock() pair,
you need a full memory barrier before the READ_ONCE(), even on x86.
Without that memory barrier, you don't get the effect of the release
implicit in spin_unlock().

For weaker architectures, such as PowerPC and ARM, a READ_ONCE()
does -not- suffice, not at all, even with smp_mb() before and after.
I encourage you to take a look at arch_spin_unlock_wait() in arm64
and powerpc if youi are interested.  There were also some lengthy LKML
threads discussing this about 18 months ago that could be illuminating.

And yes, there are architecture-specific optimizations for an
empty spin_lock()/spin_unlock() critical section, and the current
arch_spin_unlock_wait() implementations show some of these optimizations.
But I expect that performance benefits would need to be demonstrated at
the system level.
