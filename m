My apologies I said that there was nothing network namespace specific
left to talk about and I had goofed in my analysis.  The weirdness with
references comes from how struct pernet_operations is used.

Structures of type struct pernet_operations hold holds pointers to .init
functions marked as __net_init and .exit and .exit_batch marked as
__net_exit.

The assertion is that references from static instances of struct
pernet_operations that live in __net_initdata should be ok.


Structures of type pernet_operations are passed to
register_pernet_subsys or register_pernet_device which ultimately call
register_pernet_operations.  Register pernet_operations when the network
namespace is disabled simply calls the .init function when the network
namespace code is compiled out.  The .exit and .exit_batch functions
are not referenced at all.

When the network namespace code is compiled in __net_init __net_exit
and __net_initdata all go away.

So the exit function references only permitted code.  But the exit
function is being referenced by data in an init section which requires
the override.

How should we mark functions in __net_exit that can be thrown away
when outside of a module and never even loaded when compiled into the
kernel when the network namespace is disabled?

The original definition of __exit_refok seemed to say this very clearly
to me.  This is an __exit section but references to it from __init data
are ok.
