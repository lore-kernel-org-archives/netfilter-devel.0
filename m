If it helps, you could use "bpfc", or rip-off its code to not have a
dependency; it's part of the netsniff-ng toolkit.

It can be used like:

bpfc examples/bpfc/arp.bpf
{ 0x28, 0, 0, 0x0000000c },
{ 0x15, 0, 1, 0x00000806 },
{ 0x6, 0, 0, 0xffffffff },
{ 0x6, 0, 0, 0x00000000 },

where arp.bpf is, for instance:

_main:
  ldh [12]
  jeq #0x806, keep, drop
keep:
  ret #0xffffffff
drop:
  ret #0

"Core" files are: src/bpf_lexer.l, src/bpf_parser.y

It also supports all Linux ANC-operations that were added to the
kernel (like VLAN, XOR and so on). I started but didn't have time to
continue a higher-level language for that, that would translate to
such an example above (which then translates again to opcodes).
