For small or simple cases, this may be true..but there is a lot of work
to make a complex user-space app that manages arbitrary amounts of interfaces
routing tables in an arbitrary amount of network namespaces.  With the contrack-zones
approach, user-space apps do not require any significant changes, and you do not
need the rest of the namespace overhead to accomplish the task.
