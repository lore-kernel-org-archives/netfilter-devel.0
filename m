Hiding the packets from the hooks dependant on the xfrm_state is always
a problem with NAT, because when we do a second xfrm lookup after NAT
it is already to late to hide the packets.

I agree that its the job of policy checks, but its often simpler to
add a policy which includes just IP addresses and use iptables for
filtering. Connection state, TCP flags, ..., can't be handled using
policy checks, and netfilter might also be used for marking, TCP MSS
rewriting, proxy redirection, ...

Yes, we could add new hooks and duplicate the relevant code from the
IP input path. But I think just sending the packets through the stack
again is cleaner.

The idea was to usually hide transport mode packets on the output path
from netfilter hooks, unless a special flag in the xfrm_state is set.
On input the flag would make a packet decapsulated from a transport mode
SA through the stack again. But it has the same problem wrt. NAT I
described above as hiding unconditionally.
