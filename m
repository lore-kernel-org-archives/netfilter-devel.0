Then 'the documentation' needs fixing.
cgroup (and anything related to sk data, including uid, etc.) is
not guaranteed to work.

We can only match what is available in the packet payload, and
some extra info that the stack can make available to us (e.g.
VLAN id, or skb->sk in some cases on output) and conntrack state plus
whatever extra data conntrack allows to attach.

True.

-v please.

Two things:
- keep it out of core network stack
- make it explicit so we can document that 'demux' keyword is fishy and
will not work reliably.

F.e. I don't see how mcast could ever be made to work except by adding
an entirely new filtering mechanism/new hooks in core stack.

Yes, something like that.  Obviously, you'll need to dru^W brib^W
convince a LOT of people before that could ever fly.

I think we should not do this and that this 'match on ingress sk
properties' is just bad[tm].

f.e. you'd also have to move all of the stuff you want into
sock_common ... 8-(

Starts to smell like snet (https://lwn.net/Articles/441587/)

Sorry, I think netfilter is wrong tool for this, at least for ingress.
You could use conntrack to stash net_cls id in the connmark, though (for
inbound reply packets).
