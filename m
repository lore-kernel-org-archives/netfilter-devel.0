That seems to be papering over some of the obvious cracks.

The fact that the entire 32bits are zeroed makes me suspect that
in some places values are written as 8 bits and read later as 32.
The only way that can work on BE is if the values are always written
as 32 bit ones (assignment style 2).

OTOH using memcmp(,,2) relies on the data being in the lower addressed
bytes.

If the data does need to be in the lower addressed bytes I'd suggest
using a union rather than all the casts.
