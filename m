yes=A3=ACNetwork namespaces in general can be cleaned up in any order=A3=
=ACbut
when doing /etc/ini.d/iptables restart, the system need cleaning up
all net namespace,and init_net should be cleanup lastly.init_net is
the first namespace,other net namespace is copied for it ,and it is
diuty for Initializing resources,so It in itself is special.
