But a path has a similar problem like a file descriptor - it is local to a
certain mount namespace.

To load "large" blobs into the kernel, a pointer to user memory is a possible
option. The downside is that such extra data is not retrievable from the kernel
via the iptables setsockopts anymore - one could work around it with procfs, or
just let it be.
