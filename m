Very good point.  I guess that when Patrick suggested using
current->nsproxy->net_ns, he meant only for the module_params part.
I'll be removing that anyway.  And I'll change the code to use par->net
instead of current->nsproxy->net_ns to avoid the problem in _destroy.

Thanks for your comments!

I must admit that I was a bit insecure about this code.  That's why I
sent a RFC early enough. ;)
