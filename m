Yes, this is a good idea. This could be useful to match things like 
interrogation marks or asterisks that are usually used as wildcard.

Looks good but Boyer-Moore algorithm doesn't need this at all. BM 
doesn't support wildcards like '*' because of the shiftings that it uses 
to look for matches. This issue together with memory consumption are two 
limitations that we have to live with if we want to use BM. Anyway I 
think it's worth it because we can perform search in O(n/m).
