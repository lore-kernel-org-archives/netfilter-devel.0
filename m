I thinks this BUG is a netfilter BUG,not a netns BUG.
Other subsystems implemented netns support don't use init_net to
do some special works((un)register/(un)set).

In fact,we can't use init_net to do this job well.such as function
nf_conntrack_clean,we shoud set ip_ct_attach to NULL before any
netns doing cleanup jobs, and set nf_ct_destroy to NULL after all of
netns finish these cleanup jobs.

So I think finally we still need this patchset,And this is a regular
way to fix this problem.

Can you help me to test if the panic bug is fixed by this patchset?
and then give me your tested-by?

thank you very much!
