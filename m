Ewww, can I?

Regardless of netns, switching to

	struct nf_conntrack nf_conntrack_untracked;

means we must be absolutely sure that every place which uses, say,
ct->status won't get untracked conntrack.

For example, does setting IPS_NAT_DONE_MASK and IPS_CONFIRMED_BIT on
untracked conntracked really necessary?

In conntrack_mt_v0() "ct->status" can be used even for untracked connection,
is this right?
