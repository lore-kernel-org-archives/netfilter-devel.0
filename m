Oops, xt_recent.c.

"When was the last time you needed to change the default ownership
when you _also_ have the possibility to chown each procfs file
individually?"

if kp->arg is 1, ((u8*)cond_net + kp->arg) yields a pointer that's
usually not aligned for u32. (And C pedants would probably argue
that is should be char* not u8*, even if the one is a typedef
of another.)
