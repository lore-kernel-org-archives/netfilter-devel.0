Sorry, I should have done that.

Okay, I'm looking it over.  Sorry for the mess.

I'll review it, and test it.  Can you tell me what steps you took to
reproduce the oops?  I'll enable slab debugging and try to reproduce
without and with this patch (and I'll also look into David's recent
email as well).  Are you simply creating and removing network
namespaces (I did test that, but I should have done a better job)?

That should be correct, the nf_hook_mutex is only for protecting the
lists.
