Cyrill please retest this final patch and let me know if it still works
properly.

I looked at ipv6, and it's more complicated.  The problem is that ipv6
doesn't mark the inet6dev object as dead in the NETDEV_DOWN case, in
fact it keeps the object around.  It only releases it and marks it
dead in the NETDEV_UNREGISTER case.

We pay a very large price for having allowed the behavior of ipv6 and
ipv4 to diverge so greatly in these areas :-(

Nevertheless we should try to fix it somehow, maybe we can detect the
situation in another way for the ipv6 side.

====================
ipv4: Don't do expensive useless work during inetdev destroy.

When an inetdev is destroyed, every address assigned to the interface
is removed.  And in this scenerio we do two pointless things which can
be very expensive if the number of assigned interfaces is large:

1) Address promotion.  We are deleting all addresses, so there is no
   point in doing this.

2) A full nf conntrack table purge for every address.  We only need to
   do this once, as is already caught by the existing
   masq_dev_notifier so masq_inet_event() can skip this.
