Ugh, I'm still finding the least ugly way to put init_net checks, and
it's better to do it at the very end.

So, slight reordering.

See per-netns statistics, nf_conntrack_count, nf_conntrack_checksum,
nf_conntrack_log_invalid and accounting.

The rest (SIP, H323, GRE, PPTP, per-netns NAT) remains the same and can
be applied independently of init_net checks.
