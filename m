Unless I am missing something subtle, the kgdb_cpu_enter() function in
question has a local_irq_save() over the "interesting" portion of its
workings, so interrupt-handler self-deadlock should not happen.

That was an embarrassing bug, no two ways about it.  :-/

Again, no need in this case.

But I agree with Will's assessment of this function...

The raw_spin_is_locked() looks to be asking if -any- CPU holds the
dbg_slave_lock, and the answer could of course change immediately
on return from raw_spin_is_locked().  Perhaps the theory is that
if other CPU holds the lock, this CPU is supposed to be subjected to
kgdb_roundup_cpus().  Except that the CPU that held dbg_slave_lock might
be just about to release that lock.  Odd.

Seems like there should be a get_online_cpus() somewhere, but maybe
that constraint is to be manually enforced.

							Thanx, Paul
