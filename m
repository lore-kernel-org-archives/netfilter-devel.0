Patrick just pointed this out, too.  I wasn't sure whether
local_bh_disable() would make the context really look like softirq in
every way.  If yes, it would certainly solve the problem, because
in_interrupt() at hardirq-exit would be true and therefore the timer
softirq not scheduled immediately.

I'll have Astaro test this variant.
