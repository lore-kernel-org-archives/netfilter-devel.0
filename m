Yes, that code is indeed buggy. The below patch should fix it, although
the page tables probably won't contain anything interesting, and it
could still be a memory corruption issue. And it definitely won't fix
the real issue.

I have a couple of patches that will eliminate the need for this fixup
(and probably improve performance as well), but they are probably 2.6.26
material.
