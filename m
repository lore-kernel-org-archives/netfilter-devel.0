Well, they "fit" as they're global because modules are global.
So we can make every netns hashtable size equals to module param,
or make it bounded by module param
or make initial hashtable size and not bounded
or million other things.

I meant net->ct.htable_size in hash functions _if_ you're not allowing
changing it from inside netns.

But whatever. I think per-netns hashtable size shouldn't be done
that late.
