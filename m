I think its preferrable to make the need to handle NETLINK_F_DUMP_INTR
as noticable as possible and not hide it. Silent failure is the worst
kind of failure.

Yeah. The point could be made that this is a regression though. We didn't
require userspace to deal with interruptions before, and the behaviour
was well defined and acceptable for most cases, its not anymore.

So I think it should be handled by the kernel, without changes to
userspace.
