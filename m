Aha! So in your patch __inet_del_ifa bypass first blocking_notifier_call_chain

__inet_del_ifa
	...
	if (in_dev->dead)
		goto no_promotions;

	// First call to NETDEV_DOWN
...
no_promotions:
	rtmsg_ifa(RTM_DELADDR, ifa1, nlh, portid);
	blocking_notifier_call_chain(&inetaddr_chain, NETDEV_DOWN, ifa1);

and here we call for NETDEV_DOWN, which then hits masq_device_event
and go further to conntrack code.
