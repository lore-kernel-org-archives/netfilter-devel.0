The idea is that the kernel is performing an active query. I agree
that there's nothing wrong with installing the SA and indicating the
error to userspace. Userspace could dump the SADB and look for new
larval states, however thats unlikely to be very useful since once
an overflow occurs, you probably have a lot of states.

But unless I'm missing something, there's nothing wrong with this
as long as the error is ignored. The fact that something was received
by some listener doesn't have any meaning anyways, it might have
been "ip monitor". Which somehow raises doubt about your proposed
interface change though, I think anything that wants a reliable
answer whether a packet was delivered to a process handling it
appropriately should use unicast.
