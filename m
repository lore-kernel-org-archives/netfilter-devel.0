Please attach patches inline and send netfilter related patches to
netfilter-devel@lists.netfilter.org.

I don't see how this would change anything, the PRE_ROUTING hook
doesn't change the source address, so the comparison is unnecessary,
additionally the dst_release is only needed for loopback because
packets received from a real interface don't have a route attached
at this time.
