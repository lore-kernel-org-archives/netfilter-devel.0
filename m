Hello all,

I have a module that exports a /proc entry which takes a string with 4
args in it (src IP/port and dst IP/port) and then attempts to delete
the conntrack entry for the TCP connection associated with those
arguments. Here's the code in question (keep reading past the code for
a description of the problem I'm having):

<code>
static inline int kill_ct_record( const struct ip_conntrack *c, void *p)
{
        struct ip_conntrack *q = (struct ip_conntrack *)p;

        if (!memcmp( &c->tuplehash[IP_CT_DIR_ORIGINAL],
                     &q->tuplehash[IP_CT_DIR_ORIGINAL],
                     sizeof( struct ip_conntrack_tuple_hash))) {
                ip_conntrack_put( q);
                return 1;
        }
        return 0;
}

static int delete_ct_record( u_int32_t src, u_int16_t sport, u_int32_t
dst, u_int16_t dport)
{
        struct ip_conntrack_tuple tuple;
        struct ip_conntrack_tuple_hash *h;

        memset( &tuple, 0, sizeof( tuple));
        tuple.src.ip = src;
        tuple.src.u.tcp.port = sport;
        tuple.dst.ip = dst;
        tuple.dst.u.tcp.port = dport;
        tuple.dst.protonum = IPPROTO_TCP;
        h = ip_conntrack_find_get( &tuple, NULL);
        if (!h)
                return -ENOENT;
        ip_ct_selective_cleanup( kill_ct_record, h->ctrack);
        return 1;
}
</code>

The problem is as follows: 

In the kill_ct_record() function, if the ip_conntrack_put() call is
not commented out, this causes the box to go into some infinite loop
after some unspecified amount of time. There is no LKCD dump and I
don't know what happened since I wasn't physically present for it
happening at any of the instances.

On the other hand, when the ip_conntrack_put() call _is_ commented
out, the system leaks memory from conntrack as indicated in the
ip_conntrack line in /proc/slabinfo. But the crash doesn't happen
under that condition.

So, is there a cleaner way to hand-delete a conntrack record? Or is
this the only method? Or is there some error in the way that I am
doing the above?

By the way, this is almost exactly what ctnetlink does to delete a
conntrack record so any errors discovered here will almost surely have
to be fixed there, as well.
