Option 1:
     fastpath:
         spin_lock(local_lock)
         smp_mb(); [[1]]
         smp_load_acquire(global_flag);
     slow path:
         global_flag = 1;
         smp_mb();
         <spin_unlock_wait_without_cacheline_dirtying>

Option 2:
     fastpath:
         spin_lock(local_lock);
         smp_load_acquire(global_flag)
     slow path:
         global_flag = 1;
         spin_lock(local_lock);spin_unlock(local_lock).

Rational:
The ACQUIRE from spin_lock is at the read of local_lock, not at the write.
i.e.: Without the smp_mb() at [[1]], the CPU can do:
         read local_lock;
         read global_flag;
         write local_lock;
For Option 2, the smp_mb() is not required, because fast path and slow 
path acquire the same lock.

I agree :-)
