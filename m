On powerpc, we use the generic one and it's fast :-) Well, at least on
ppc64, bcs we do lazy irq disabling, disabling/enabling interrupt is
basically just poking a byte in a per-cpu data structure (there's a tad
more work on enable in case the interrupt actually occured and we ended
up really disabling but that's not the common case). Overall faster than
using the atomic ops which have to go all the way to the L2 cache.

So if you define the above, please set in on powerpc despite the fact
that we use the generic implementation.

Cheers,
Ben.
