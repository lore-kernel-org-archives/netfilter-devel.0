I'm afraid that's not good enough. The resize operation is deferred,
so even if userspace does not perform an operation after starting
the dump, the hash might change.

We can obviously work around that by incrementing a generation
counter in rhashtable. The main problem I see is that with something
very actively changing the ruleset, we might never complete a dump.

Dumps are usually rare, I think its preferrable to defer rehashing.
