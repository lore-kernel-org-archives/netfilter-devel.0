Yes. Least thing we need is one humongous patch. :)

One thing to be generally aware about is that things could potentially
be instantiated by another entity between the time a label was looked up
with negative result and the time one tries to add it.
It may thus be required to extend keeping the lock until after
idletimer_tg_create, in other words, lookup and create must be atomic
to the rest of the world.
