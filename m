Thanks, I'll pass these to David.

I have also two more to fixes to oopses regarding SIP. I'm expecting
one user to finally confirm that their issues are fixed.

Thanks, I was keeping the previous patchset in one branch:

http://1984.lsi.us.es/git/nf-next/log/?h=nf-nat4

You can also find forward ports of netlink-mmap (from Florian Westpal)
and one for nftables from myself in that tree.

We have this branch for iptables IPv6 NAT:

http://git.netfilter.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=iptables.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/nf-nat

Let me know if you're OK with these.
