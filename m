Your patch does solve the reassembly problem when macvlans are defined, thanks!

A tad unrelated, but i think there's still some ipv6 multicast filtering 
work to be done in the macvlan driver. If you for example join an all scope 
mcast address, ff09::1 on macvlan 0 it will implicitly be 'joined' on all 
other macvlans aswell..

I can buy that linklocal multicast packets are cloned out to all macvlan devices,
but if a specific prefix is joined on one of them, i dont think it's correct that
all sibling devices should receive that traffic, unless they asked for it.
