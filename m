I just tried to bring the code in line as it already is for
NFT_META_RTCLASSID and NFT_META_SECMARK. But, obviously, I messed it
up by missing the nft_meta_get_init() function. Sorry for that!

The init function gets called prior to the eval function (see
nft_expr_init() and nf_tables_newrule()). If it returns an error, the
latter won't be called. So the fix is, to add the #ifdef to
nft_meta_get_init() as well.

Another direct caller of  nft_meta_get_eval() is
nft_meta_bridge_get_eval(). However, it also complies to the init /
eval rule by calling nft_meta_get_init() in its init function, so will
error out in the case, too.

I'll send a v2 soon.

Thanks for the review!

Sorry. I should have taken more attention.


Thanks,
