I have a patchset that is almost ready to convert netfilter to pernet
hooks, it partially clashes with this. Will send it out today and will
Cc you so you can review it.

I think it should take me little time to rebase it on top of yours.
It's rather large changeset, which quite a lot of boiler plate code
though.
