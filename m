I'll dig up my scripts and post them to github this weekend. They
are a bit organized and all over the place at the moment.

Maybe we can build a master repository. I know there a lot of different
scripts running around, for example I already collected a few from
Jamal and I think Cong must have some as well.

Here is a patch that has been running on my dev box sans the quick
port to Dave's master tree. It seems to work at least it has been
running on my dev box for a few months. But I haven't had a chance to
run any recent perf numbers on it. Actually what I would really like
is to drop the lock on pfifo_fast with a lockless skb ring and make
drivers expose a descriptor ring per core (most already do anyways).
