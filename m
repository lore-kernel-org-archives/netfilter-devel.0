if it was not clear, I tried to say "why do we want to _remove_ unlock_wait".

Only if you promise to replace all RCU flavors with a single simple implementation
based on rwlock ;)

Seriously, of course I won't argue, and it seems that nobody except me likes
this primitive, but to me spin_unlock_wait() looks like synchronize_rcu(() and
sometimes it makes sense.

Including this particular case. task_work_run() is going to flush/destroy the
->task_works list, so it needs to wait until all currently executing "readers"
(task_work_cancel()'s which have started before ->task_works was updated) have
completed.

Oleg.
