Not really.

Yes, iptables as a single command works in whole tables.

USERS, on the other hand, often work in multiple iptables commands, ie 
they just add things to the tables. And in fact, I think this is the exact 
workload that Jeff complains about - doing two hundred "update table" 
commands.

The problem is, the new code makes the "wait after swap" thing happen 
after every switch. And if you do two hundred "update table" commands, you 
now take a _long_ time to update.

Sure, you could tell people to just do everything as one single table 
update, but that isn't what they do.
