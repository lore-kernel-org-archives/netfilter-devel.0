	By "come back alive" I mean when the connection isn't stalled
anymore.

189.38.18.122 -> server

10.195.195.1 -> my local VPN ip (tun1)

10.195.195.2 -> remote VPN ip (on the server)

192.168.0.2 -> my local ip (eth0)

	Should I run tcpdump on the server too, or is it sufficient to
dump just on my client machine?

	Thank you very much again.
