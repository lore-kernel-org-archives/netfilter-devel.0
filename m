256 because it is the size of a static array (and I don't want allocate=
=20
too much memory when other arrays such as the routing table names also=20
have this size). In the current version I posted some minutes ago=20
0..2^32-1  can be used.

The syntax "name/0xmask" is simply too strange for me.
