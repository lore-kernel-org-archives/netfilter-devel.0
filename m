Hrm. There are 2 and a half problems i can describe:

1) identifying namespaces. You can walk over /proc just fine and look at
   all processes namespaces, but you don't know which are actually the
   same aside from looking at some entry like if_inet6. There is no
   identifier and no easy equality match. (As far as i can tell.)

   Bonus difficulty: your patch will allow namespaces that have no
   process attached to them anymore since they only exist as files.
   Those will be invisible to someone running through /proc. Which leads
   to:
2) enumerating namespaces. Sure you can walk through /proc, but that's
   racy and won't even work with fd-only namespaces. It might even be a
   security risk if some trojan creates, say, a VLAN on your eth0, or a
   macvlan, hides it in a network namespace and communicates through it.

2 1/2) is terminating a namespace. It's not really a problem to add a
   PID namespace when you have "uncontrollable" daemons; however you
   can't be sure whether someone else took a reference on the network
   namespace from the outside.

These all are mainly administration/management issues, not that much
regular operation. Writing routing software with VRF support works just
fine, but the sysadmin can be at somewhat of an odd end here.
