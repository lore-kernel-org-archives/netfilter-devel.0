SYN-flood case is just a side effect. What I want to do is eliminating
the second call to hash_conntrack() of the original tuple in
__nf_conntrack_confirm().

Do you mean the rnd test?

I should keep the old way, but fix a race.

        if (unlikely(!nf_conntrack_hash_rnd_initted)) {
                get_random_bytes(&nf_conntrack_hash_rnd,
                                sizeof(nf_conntrack_hash_rnd));
                nf_conntrack_hash_rnd_initted =3D 1;
        }

nf_conntrack_alloc() isn't called with in the nf_conntrack_lock. So
the above code maybe executed more than once on different CPUs. It is
easy to fix with the cmpxchg() trick.

Thanks.
