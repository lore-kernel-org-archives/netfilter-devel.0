Thanks a lot for your review :)

Fixed, thanks.

We try not to be implementation specific (people might still be
using this once more implementations have appeared), so keeping
the larger timeout seems safer. It doesn't really hurt since
the connection will get evicted under pressure as long as it
hasn't moved to PARTOPEN with a correct ACK sequence number.
Something more specific in the RFC would be nice though.

Thanks, fixed already in my tree.

I just copied this part from the TCP helper because I didn't
find a better value. Does the wraparound affect the maximum
lifetime of a connection? Maybe it would make sense to decrease
it in any case, I would expect applications using DCCP not
to idle as long as TCP connections might.

Yes, ignored packets just never cause state transistions.

I chose seconds because its consistent with what other conntrack
protocols use and less likely to confuse users.

All packets go through dccp_error() first, which catches invalid
packet types.

Yes, this is something I still wanted to look into. The reason
why its duplicated is that the DCCP protocol functions assume
skb->transport_header to point to the DCCP header. This is
only true for packets in the protocol layer.

Yes, this is one of the differences that comes from sitting in
the middle :) In the reply direction we transition from sRQ to
sRS when receiving a Response. However, that response might not
make it to the client or simply be late, in which case the request
is retransmitted.

Generally, for all states that exist only on one side (and we
transistion to it even if the packet might never reach the other
side), we must accept all packets in the other direction as in
the previous state.

We track both sides, so we must also define which client packets
are valid in which server state. This particular one is part of
the unfinished resync feature. The firewall might be out of sync
with both endpoints. If connection pickup is enabled it should
let packets that might establish a new connection pass and resync
when the other side responds with a valid Response. I need to
think about this a bit more, but I've marked it with FIXME for
now :)

Yes, I'll change this. The tricker case is a reincarnation in the
reverse direction. The conntrack entry must be killed and recreated
since the state table is directional and the client/server roles
change. Also needs a bit more thought.

Thanks, fixed.

In case the client needs to respond with another Close it should
probably move to sCR. Otherwise I'd change it to stay (explicitly)
in sCG. Ignore is mainly for resyncing.

NAT shouldn't make any difference for the states. The table is
directional, so the Close transistion here is always a Close
after a CloseReq from the server, so its also invalid.

>      o simplest option - maybe better to use sCR -> sIG or drop packet.

IIRC I used sCG because I couldn't figure out whether its
valid :) I'll change it to INVALID.

Thanks again for your review.
