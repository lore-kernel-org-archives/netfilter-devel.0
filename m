No, ip_route_me_harder is currently (without the patches) only called
for outgoing packets. The if-clause is there because ip_route_output
doesn't handle packets with non-local source, and we don't want to set
the source to 0 (as was done before) because it prevents policy routing
from working properly. That's why we need the xfrm_lookup for both
cases.
