They're copied to userspace after replacing the ruleset, associated with
the rules that are still active after the change and then added to the
current counters in a second operation. The end result is that the
counters are accurate for rules not changed.

People use netfilter for accounting quite a lot. Having dynamic updates
is also not uncommon, so this might actually matter.
