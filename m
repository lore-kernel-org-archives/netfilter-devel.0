The NAT nul-binding is triggering the source port mangling, even if
there is no NAT rules in place. The following patch skips the clash
resolution for NAT by now since we don't see a simple solution for
this case at the moment.

Could you give a try to this patch in these two cases?

1) No NAT in place: Make sure iptable_nat module is not there. Or if
   you're using nf_tables, just make sure you have no nat chains at
   all.

2) With NAT in place, you hit back the EPERM errors that you've
   observed so far.

Please, test both scenarios and report back. Thanks.

Subject: [PATCH] netfilter: conntrack: skip clash resolution if nat is in
 place

The clash resolution is not easy to apply if the NAT table is
registered. Even if no NAT rules are installed, the nul-binding ensures
that a unique tuple is used, thus, the packet that loses race gets a
different source port number, as described by:

http://marc.info/?l=netfilter-devel&m=146818011604484&w=2

Clash resolution with NAT is also problematic if addresses/port range
ports are used since the conntrack that wins race may describe a
different mangling that we may have earlier applied to the packet via
nf_nat_setup_info().
