Commit 130549fe added code to reset nf_trace in nf_reset(). This is wrong
and unnecessary.

nf_reset() is used in the following cases:

- when passing packets up the the socket layer, at which point we want to
  release all netfilter references that might keep modules pinned while
  the packet is queued. nf_trace doesn't matter anymore at this point.

- when encapsulating or decapsulating IPsec packets. We want to continue
  tracing these packets after IPsec processing.

- when passing packets through virtual network devices. Only devices on
  that encapsulate in IPv4/v6 matter since otherwise nf_trace is not
  used anymore. Its not entirely clear whether those packets should
  be traced after that, however we've always done that.

- when passing packets through virtual network devices that make the
  packet cross network namespace boundaries. This is the only cases
  where we clearly want to reset nf_trace and is also what the
  original patch intended to fix.

Add a new function nf_reset_trace() and use it in dev_forward_skb() to
fix this properly.
