It happens in the kmem_cache_free in nf_conntrack_free (as I can
trivially confirm with printk), so you're almost certainly right, but I
am just shoving in a bunch of debug code equivalent to the logic in SLUB
kmem cache freeing to see precisely how that pointer corruption occurs,
mostly for curiosity, and to confirm for sure what happens.
