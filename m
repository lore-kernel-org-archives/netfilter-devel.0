Joe described it nicely, problem is that after unload we may have
conntracks that still have a nf_conn_help extension attached that
has a pointer to a structure that resided in the (unloaded) module.

Normally these references should have been NULL'd out by
nf_ct_iterate_destroy(), however, there is a small chance that
its for_each_net() misses namespaces already removed-from-list by
concurrent netns workqueue cleanup.

I guess another solution to fix this would be to add dummy pernet
ops to all conntrack helpers so they block on unregister_pernet_subsys().

But thats rather ugly IMO since they don't have any notion of a net
namespace in first place.
