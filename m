You usually need extra userspace daemons to make something useful
out of the data and I doubt many people are running them. It doesn't
hurt to optimize it anyways of course :)

But I'm somewhat doubtful that we're actually having lock contention
here. One thing we could do with your lock hash change is to perform
the counter updates while holding those locks, that avoids taking
a different lock just for the counters. The only reason why its done
in nf_ct_refresh is that it was already taking the conntrack lock,
but if thats no longer the case, no reason to keep it there.
