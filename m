Nothing.  Our fault.  br_nf_core.o should not be built in this case.

This patch seems to fix it for me.  Pablo, can you double-check?

Thanks!

Subject: [PATCH nf-next] netfilter: bridge: build br_nf_core only if re=
quired

Eric reports build failure with
CONFIG_BRIDGE_NETFILTER=3Dn

We insist to build br_nf_core.o unconditionally, but we must only do so
if br_netfilter was enabled, else it fails to build due to
functions being defined to empty stubs (and some structure members
being defined out).

Also, BRIDGE_NETFILTER=3Dy|m makes no sense when BRIDGE=3Dn.
