Hi David,

The following batch contains Netfilter fixes for 3.8-rc1. They are
a mixture of old bugs that have passed unnoticed (I'll pass these to
stable) and more fresh ones from the previous merge window, they are:

* Fix for MAC address in 6in4 tunnels via NFLOG that results in ulogd
  showing up wrong address, from Bob Hockney.

* Fix a comment in nf_conntrack_ipv6, from Florent Fourcot.

* Fix a leak an error path in ctnetlink while creating an expectation,
  from Jesper Juhl.

* Fix missing ICMP time exceeded in the IPv6 defragmentation code, from
  Haibo Xi.

* Fix inconsistent handling of routing changes in MASQUERADE for the
  new connections case, from Andrew Collins.

* Fix a missing skb_reset_transport in ip[6]t_REJECT that leads to
  crashes in the ixgbe driver (since it seems to access the transport
  header with TSO enabled), from Mukund Jampala.

* Recover obsoleted NOTRACK target by including it into the CT and spot
  a warning via printk about being obsoleted. Many people don't check the
  scheduled to be removal file under Documentation, so we follow some
  less agressive approach to kill this in a year or so. Spotted by Florian
  Westphal, patch from myself.

* Fix race condition in xt_hashlimit that allows to create two or more
  entries, from myself.

* Fix crash if the CT is used due to the recently added facilities to
  consult the dying and unconfirmed conntrack lists, from myself.

That's basically it, you can pull these changes from:

git://1984.lsi.us.es/nf master

Have a nice entrance for the new year. Thanks.
