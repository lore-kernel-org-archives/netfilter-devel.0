1) the first patch is a tiny patch that changes the #define-s for the
NET_XMIT_* return values and provides quick inline functions that
determine if *a* packet was dropped ("a packet" does not necessarily
mean "the" packet that was enqueued!) this is not just cosmetic but it's
useful later on.

furthermore, in some places the code makes me think that there has been 
a lack of update... in those places it was assumpted that the success or
insuccess was somewhat binary (either 0 or NET_XMIT_SUCCESS or != 
NET_XMIT_SUCCESS)...
