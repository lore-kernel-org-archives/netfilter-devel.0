The system I am using is being borrowed under an open ended loan.  However, my 
use of it can be thought of as being the "null process" in VMS - once anyone else 
wants it I have to get off of it.

That said, I would guess that the chances of someone else trying to get that 
system are pretty small for the next four+ weeks.  I had a similar system (PCIe 
I/O rather than PCI-X) for quite a few weeks before it got pulled-out from under.
