Sparc64 doesn't have the problems, it just fixes up the unaligned
accesses there so it'll just be super-slow (some "optimization" :).

The problem is on parisc64 which is very strict about accessing
structure members which are not aligned to the accessor type you use
to dereference and gives you a link/compile error when you violate
this.

Yes.

I understand, but instead create an arch routine to optimize this
instead of using non-portable constructs.  memcmp_masked() or
something like that.
