I know, but the situation is a little bit more complicated: the set type 
in question works differently with IPv4 and IPv6. In the IPv4 case, a 
range of IP addresses as IPv4/prefix is accepted as input (thus 
192.168.1.1/32 too), while for IPv6, only plain IPv6 addresses are allowed 
and therefore 20a1:1:2:3:4:5:6:7/128 was rejected.

That looks really odd so I added the feature (but could not resist to add 
my comment as a pseudo-question :-).

Best regards,
Jozsef
