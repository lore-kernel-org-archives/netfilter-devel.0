That's not very constructive criticism, Yoshifuji-san ;)

There aren't that many ways of doing this "hack" cleanly.

The fact of the matter is: the proxy needs to scan through the unicast
packets to filter out the Neighbor Discovery packets, if it supports NUD.

I think a netfilter module is the cleanest way of doing this. It doesn't
change any interfaces either inside the kernel, or to userspace. As a
module this feature is also easy to turn on if you want it, and it doesn'=
t
cause any preformance penalties if you don't.

What kind of solution do you propose for this problem?

Regards,
Ville
