Indeed, good catch.  Therefore:

1) Keep the masq netdev notifier.  That will flush the conntrack table
   for the inetdev_destroy event.

2) Make the inetdev notifier only do something if inetdev->dead is
   false.  (ie. we are flushing an individual address)

And then we don't need the NETDEV_UNREGISTER thing at all:
