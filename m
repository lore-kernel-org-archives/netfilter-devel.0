In that case we have to use ipv6_find_hdr(..., IPPROTO_IPCOMP, ...),
since par->thoff will point to the last header which is esp. After
this change, the ipcomp ipv6 match will look very similar to what you
have in ah_mt6(...) in net/ipv6/netfilter/ip6t_ah.c. Please, rework
that in your ipcomp match patch and resend. Thanks.
