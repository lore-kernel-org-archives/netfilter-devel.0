Thanks. What's the problem with setns?

Yes, I saw this from patches. Eric, I'd very much appreciate if we
workout a solution that will allow us to kill two birds with one stone.
I do not want to invent yet another bunch of system calls for "taking
weak reference".

As a "brain storm" start up. Can we use inotify/dnotify for this? 
Or maybe we should better equip the nsfd call with flags argument and 
add a flag for weak reference? In that case - how shall we get a 
notification about namespace is dead? With poll? Maybe worth making
the sys_close return only when the namespace is dead (by providing a
proper ->release callback of a file)?
