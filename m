Btw, I think that's a bad assumption.

The thing is, nobody can really care if the new rules are in effect or 
not, because the thing you race with is not the "return to user space" 
part, but the incoming packets.

And those incoming packets might have been incoming before the rules were 
set up too.

So I seriously doubt you need to synchronize with any returning to user 
space. What you want to synchronize with is then later actions that do 
things like turning on the interface that the rules are attached to etc!

So I would suggest:

 - remove the synchronize_net() entirely. Replace it with just freeing the 
   old rules using RCU.

 - new packets will always end up seeing the new rules. That includes the 
   case of somebody doing "ifconfig eth0 up" that enables a new source of 
   packets, so there are no real security issues.

 - if you enabled your network interfaces before you updated your packet 
   filtering rules, you already had a window where packets would come in 
   with the old rules, so doing a "synchronize_net()" in no way protects 
   against any race conditions anyway.

Am I missing something?
