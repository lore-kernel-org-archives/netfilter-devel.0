So this analysis of a problem appears to be spot on.

I really really want there to be a better way to do this, but it is
really not ok for a hook to continue it's life past
nf_unregister_net_hook as after that point the code may be removed
from the kernel (sigh).

Although keeping with the precedent and minimizing net_mutex
we could remove the WARN and keep nf_register_hook as it is.
But that sounds entirely too clever for a fix that will
probably be backported.
