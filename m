Note that as the ipv6 inet notifier is atomic; now that
nf_ct_iterate_cleanup can schedule the ipv6 masq version defers the
cleanup to a work queue, with a backlog cap of 16.  So in case
of a gazillion events most will be ignored and teardown should not be
delayed (at least not even close to what ipv4 masq did).
