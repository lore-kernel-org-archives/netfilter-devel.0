Even if it's a module, I don't think there's any dependency here, as
the only interface that cls_cgroup and netfilter_cgroup need is
task_cls_classid(), which is an inline function and doesn't involve any
EXPORT symbol.

Therefore it works even if CONFIG_CLS_CGROUP doesn't depend of
CONFIG_NET_CGROUP_CLASSID.
