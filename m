Not sure if thats true.  What about Timewait sockets?

Its easy to imagine someone using this feature and then complaining
that it doesn't match some packets, at which point we'd have to grow
sock_common to accomondate all sk member we support matching for :-/

If we'd have kernel releases where we drop features this wouldn't be
much of an issue since we could back out in case it causes issues later.

But once we add your proposed feature we cannot go back...

I'm not sure; I dislike this feature proposal but I can't think of
any alternative [other than "don't do this"] :-(
