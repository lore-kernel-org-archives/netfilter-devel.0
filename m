Agree. But what if we enter a pid space, which is a subnamespace of a current
one? In that case parent will still see the task by its old pid. We can restrict
first version of entering with this rule as well and this restriction will not
block us in typical usecase (I mean enter a container from a host).

OK, but what if we try to allocate the same pid returning -EBUSY on failure?

My aim is to provide even a restricted enter. For most of the cases this
should work and make our lives easier. So two restrictions currently:
a) enter a sub namespace
b) allocate the same pid as we have now

Hm? :)

Good!

OK. I'll spend some time playing with it next week then.
