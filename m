I'm unsure whether this is the right approach.  So if I understand
this correctly your problem is coming from packets that are

	IP stack => bridge => IP stack

in which case preserving IP options may work.

But does your patch handle packets that are

	external => bridge => IP stack

The reason I asked for the IPCB to be built is to handle exactly
that case.

In fact, even preserving IPCB in the IP stack reentry case is
a hack since if we ever change the IP stack in future such that
on exit the IPCB is no longer valid for reentry your approach
will fail.

Now as to your original problem that ip_options_compile mangles
the packet this is something I explicitly said we should fix
before we added br_parse_ip_options (point 2 in that email):

	https://lkml.org/lkml/2010/9/3/16

Unfortunately it looks like nobody actually did the audit.

So my suggestion would be to fix br_parse_ip_options so that
it never mangles the packet.

Does this fix your problem or are there other issues that I
have overlooked?

Thanks,
