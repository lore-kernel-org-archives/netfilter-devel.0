There were several bugs that are only cured by the "per bucket
lock era" version fo rhashtable.

I only applied all of that work to net-next at the time because
suspected we'd still have to hash all of that out.

Therefore, all of the rhashtable stuff that went into 4.0-rc1
is going to need to be backported.

I also really wish Herbert Xu didn't drop off the map on this work, we
could really use his expertiece and suggestions right now. :-/
