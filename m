It happens some times every hour on the average. Seems to be some UDP 
traffic. Firewall allows in any UDP that is ESTABLISHEFD,RELATED, DHCP 
(some more UDP rules with counter 0 so not important). Additionally 
there is internal netowkr that sometimes has a laptop but usually not 
and the messages have appeared also when there is nothin in the internal 
network.

Locally mldonkey is probably using UDP, and lsof -i | grep UDP tells 
that named, avahi-daemon, dhcpd, chronyd, nmbd and cupsd are listening 
on UDP sockets (most of them on internal network).

But I have no idea what application is causing the messages.
