this commit is now in mainline as
e3b37f11e6e4e6b6f02cc762f182ce233d2c1c9d and it breaks my build:

    net/netfilter/core.c: In function 'nf_set_hooks_head':
    net/netfilter/core.c:96:3: error: 'struct net_device' has no member named 'nf_hooks_ingress'

Are the fixes (see below) on the way to mainline too?

Thanks.
