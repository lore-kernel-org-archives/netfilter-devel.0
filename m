The problem is that the masquerading code flushes the entire conntrack
table once for _every_ address removed.

The code path is:

masq_device_event()
	if (event == NETDEV_DOWN) {
		/* Device was downed.  Search entire table for
		 * conntracks which were associated with that device,
		 * and forget them.
		 */
		NF_CT_ASSERT(dev->ifindex != 0);

		nf_ct_iterate_cleanup(net, device_cmp,
				      (void *)(long)dev->ifindex, 0, 0);

So if you have a million IP addresses, this flush happens a million times
on inetdev destroy.

Part of the problem is that we emit NETDEV_DOWN inetdev notifiers per
address removed, instead of once per inetdev destroy.

Maybe if we put some boolean state into the inetdev, we could make sure
we did this flush only once time while inetdev->dead = 1.
