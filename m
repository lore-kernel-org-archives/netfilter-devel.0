Totally agree with you. You want to have a single classification pass
that parses the packet once and comes to a verdict immediately.

I think both have different use cases, though, but on cls_bpf side you
have maps infrastructure that is evolving as well. Not really speaking
about the other remaining classifiers, however. I also don't want to go
any further into this vim vs emacs debate. ;) And, personally, I also
don't have any issue offering alternatives to users.

However, I still disagree with moving ingress behind this artificial
barrier if it's just not necessary. I believe, in your RFC v1 patch,
you had a second ingress hook as a static key for nft, I tend to like
that much better consensus-wise. Both subsystems should not put
unnecessary barriers into their way, really.

Best,
Daniel
