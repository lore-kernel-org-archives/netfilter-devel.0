OK.

But sometimes it is better (or necessary) to prevent the migration.
Since you already are changed __mod_timer() it would be ugly to
add yet another helper. Perhaps we should turn "bool pending_only"
into "int flags" right now?

This is minor, and perhaps we will never need the TIMER_DONT_MIGRATE
flag. But if ever need, then we have to audit all callers.
