Not addressing Evgeniy's module but speaking generally...

It sure would be nice for regular socket applications to have an easy, 
unprivileged way to query the OS fingerprint information of a given socket.

Speaking purely from a userspace application API perspective, it would 
be most useful for an app to be able to stop OSF collection, start OSF 
collection, and query OSF stats.  start/stop would be a refcount that 
disables in-kernel OSF when not in use.

To present a specific use case:  I would like to know if incoming SMTP 
connections are Windows or not.  That permits me to better determine if 
the incoming connection is a hijacked PC or not -- it becomes a useful 
factor in spamassassin scoring.

In this case, incoming SMTP is -always- TCP, thus being a TCP-specific 
module is not a problem.  You cover a huge swath of apps even if the 
module is TCP-specific.

Another use case is validating whether a browser is "lying" about its 
OS, when parsing HTTP user-agent info, or in general when any remote 
agent is "lying" about its OS.  Security software can use that as an 
additional red-flag factor.
