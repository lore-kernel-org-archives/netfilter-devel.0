This patch on top of the memory mapped netlink I/O series is
meant to speed up dumps by dumping messages more aggressively.

Messages are dumped until half the ring is used, this is similar
to flow-control used with regular I/O with the difference that
all messages are constructed during a single poll call instead
of multiple recvmsg() calls.

The result is not as good as I expected, dumping 196611
routes using rtnl-route-dump from libmnl show the following
results (averaged over 10 runs):

user-time: -7.9%
system-time: -10.4%
real-time: +0.09%
CPU: -7.45%

Strangely the real time stays almost the same and CPU usage
decreases by a few percent - I would have expected a reduction
of real-time with identical CPU usage (99%). Not sure what
the reason is, will try to investigate further.

    netlink: improve flow control and speed up dumps with memory mapped I/O
    
    Improve dump flow control with memory mapped I/O: dumps are only continued
    if at least half the ring is free, similar to regular I/O. This minimizes
    the risk of receiving socket errors when the socket is also used for receiving
    regular unicast messages.
    
    Additionally speed up dumps by dumping multiple messages at once until
    the dump is either complete or less than half the ring is free.
