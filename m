Or, in some cases, per-CPU locks.  It might also be that 32-bit SMP
systems use stop-the-world approaches.

Or that we get a variant of RCU with shorter grace periods.  I don't
recommend holding your breath, but I have not given up on this.  For one
only slightly crazy example, some of the user-level RCU variants could be
adapted to in-kernel use.  Some of these have sub-microsecond grace-period
latencies, but also have some limitations that would make it difficult
for them to replace RCU wholesale in the Linux kernel.  And it is not
like we are suffering from any lack of distinct RCU implementations in
the Linux kernel just now.  :-/

However, they might be useful in isolated situations.

							Thanx, Paul
