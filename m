These patches can be folded if the result is an acceptable patch size. 
The more important is to not break the init_net. Introducing the 
namespace concept step by step, from the bottom-up in the call stack is 
good because we focus first on making the namespace available in the 
code while keeping the init_net functional. The small patches help to 
git bisect and spot the patch which lead to a regression. As the patches 
are small, it is easy to quickly find the culprit and fix it, especially 
for the people who are not author of these patches.

During this step of namespace introduction, we prevent  to unshare the 
network for ipvs, with a non-op when the namespace is not init_net.

When everything is ready and the init_net is running without problem, we 
remove the non-op and consolidate the namespace part of ipvs.

This is how I am used to do, but that does not imply it is the best way 
to do that :)
