First, a meta-comment:

What I fear is that in the end, nothing gets done because having the goal
set to perfection.  If there is no energy to drive through the
L3-independent connecting tracking, the end result is that the user does
not have this feature (remember ip6tables REJECT target?  That must have
been sitting in netfilter for some 2+ years, and not having been
integrated in the mainline kernel and the users still do not have the
feature!).

So, my personal take is:
 - if a L3-independent conn tracking can be done *quickly*, fine,
 - if not, just merge the current one, start working on L3 independent 
conn tracking, and add it when available.

.. but I'm not the one who's answering the support emails, so in all 
fairness, I should be silent now..

Two questions/comments inline:

What about LPRT and LPSV?

Btw, I would appreciate any comments regarding my draft documenting some 
IPv6-related Firewalling issues (some certainly come up when 
implementing):
