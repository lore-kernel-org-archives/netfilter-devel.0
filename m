This rings a bell here, since another crash analysis on another problem
suggested to me a potential problem with read_mostly and modules, but I
had no time to confirm the thing yet.

Could you try changing


net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_core.c:57:unsigned int nf_conntrack_htable_s=
ize __read_mostly;
to
net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_core.c:57:unsigned int nf_conntrack_htable_s=
ize ;
