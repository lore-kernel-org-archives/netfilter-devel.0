If CLONE_VM is given to clone(), the mapping is visible in both
threads and thus we have multiple mappings (vma_ops->open() is
invoked through clone()). Without CLONE_VM, the second thread
can't access the ring unless it mmap()s it itself, in case we'd
also have multiple mappings.

The file descriptor check is only meant for the case that
the fd is passed to a second process through AF_UNIX, the
first process invokes sendmsg(), sendmsg() checks for multiple
mappings and the second process invokes mmap() after that.
