I don't think the two net cgroups were a good idea and definitely
don't want to continue the trend.  I think this is being done
backwards.  Wouldn't it be more logical to implement netfilter rule to
match the target cgroup paths?  It really doesn't make much sense to
me to add separate controllers to just tag processes.  Please classify
tasks in cgroup and let netfilter match the cgroups.

Thanks.
