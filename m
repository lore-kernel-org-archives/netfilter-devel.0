Sort of.  At the same time we fundamentally need a per namespace
variable to ask if things were initialized.  So using the address as
that variable changes the equation not at all, and keeps the code
simpler.

That does not work because the real question were the things this piece
of code cares about initialized.

Very much no.

I believe that changing net_generic to return a value so that
nfqnl_nf_hook_drop can detect if the timing is wrong is an error.

I also don't think your changes to net_generic will work as the number
of pointers should have been allocted properly from the start.  

Your proposed change is just papering over the problem and fixing it at
the wrong level.  (The obvious level yes) but still the wrong level.
