OVS should call into CT NAT for packets of new expected connections only
when the conntrack state is persisted with the 'commit' option to the
OVS CT action.  The test for this condition is doubly wrong, as the CT
status field is ANDed with the bit number (IPS_EXPECTED_BIT) rather
than the mask (IPS_EXPECTED), and due to the wrong assumption that the
expected bit would apply only for the first (i.e., 'new') packet of a
connection, while in fact the expected bit remains on for the lifetime of
an expected connection.  The 'ctinfo' value IP_CT_RELATED derived from
the ct status can be used instead, as it is only ever applicable to
the 'new' packets of the expected connection.
