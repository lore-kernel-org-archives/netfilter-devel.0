I am certain of it, having augmented ipt_LOG/xt_LOGMARK temporarily by=20
appropriate printks.

No, sock_i_uid also uses sk->sk_socket. What is interesting though is=20
that sock_i_uid uses SOCK_INODE(sk->sk_socket)->i_uid, but xt_owner use=
s=20
sk->sk_socket->file->f_cred->fsuid. Would you have an idea as to why=20
that is?
Dave Howells (cced) did the last change on it.
