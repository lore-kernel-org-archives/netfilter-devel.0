Agreed, I think we can use your static key approach to drop traffic
from br_handle_frame after the work has called request_module.

Indeed.

We can keep those sysctls there in bridge.ko and deprecated them in
favour of br_netlink. I think we can add some IFLA_BRPORT_NF for the
setlink command to replace the existing global proc nf-call-thing.
We'll have to enhance the 'bridge' tool in iproute2 to support this.
I can see this is packaged in testing already by debian at least.

Agreed. By that time, we can kill the bridge.ko <-> br_netfilter.ko
dependency and the /proc call-nf-bridge stuff in favour of br_netlink.

Let me know if you still have any concern. Thanks.
