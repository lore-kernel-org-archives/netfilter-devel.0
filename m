In order to get as much data as possible, I dusted off the good old cttest 
program which was used long time ago to test and pick the currently used 
lookup2 function. I added lookup3 to cttest, converted the internals to 
follow the current netfilter/conntrack hash lookup usage and introduced a 
large enough input buffer to force cold cache. I also added the superfast 
hash by Paul Hsieh and murmur2 hash of Austin Appleby, to check those as 
well.

The test program and all the generated html pages and graphs are at
http://www.kfki.hu/~kadlec/sw/netfilter/ct3/. Here follows just a terse 
summary:

- Superfasthash is definitely not good enough as it can too easily 
  produce just too much clashes.
- The murmur2 hash is the fastest one and looks quite good, still it
  had got some trouble at specific hash table sizes.
- No weakness could be spotted with the lookup3 hash.
- When compiling with -Os, the hashes from fastest to slowest are:
  murmur2, lookup3, superfast, lookup2.
- When compiling with -O2, the hashes from fastest to slowest are:
  murmur2, superfast, lookup3 and lookup2.

In netfilter/conntrack (;-) we call the hash function for every packet, so 
even if a small number of cycle can be gained at one lookup, I think it's 
worth. And in the IPv4/IPv6 neutral nf_conntrack we hash 9 words.

The minimal code here

#include <stdint.h>

typedef uint64_t u64;
typedef uint32_t u32;
typedef uint16_t u16;
typedef uint8_t u8;

#ifdef JHASH
#include "jhash.h"
#else
#include "jhash3.h"
#endif

u32 hash(const u32 *key, u32 len, u32 initval)
{
        return jhash2(key, len, initval);
}
/* eof */

compiled with -Os, then stripped, give:

-rw-r--r-- 1 kadlec kadlec 1080 2009-02-17 14:10 lookup2.o
-rw-r--r-- 1 kadlec kadlec 1024 2009-02-17 14:10 lookup3.o

So I think the currently used lookup2 can safely be replaced with lookup3.

Best regards,
Jozsef
