You are probably correct.
The tc code has been around since about 2.6.8 and the ipt code probably
went in around 2.6.9/10; there has been fixes made to net/sched/ipt.c
when general interfaces were changed i cant rememember what that was.. 

In any case, we can make it better going forward to reduce maintainance
overhead on my part. As i was saying earlier - I am stealing a lot of
the code from iptables - so if it is that shareable, maybe it could be
converted to a library.

cheers,
jamal
