Not necessarily, they might have already been removed
(timeout, close).

I think the extra atomic_read in this code does no harm and
saves us the entire scan.  Also, in the exit path, when we hit the
'i_see_dead_people' label we restart the entire loop, so if we
have 200 netns on the list and the last one caused that restart,
we re-iterate needlesly for 199 netns...

Yes, but I see no other choice.
