I wanted to make sure that we have a known upper bound on the number of
buckets we process so that we do not block other pending kworker items
for too long.

(Or cause too many useless scans)

Another idea worth trying might be to get rid of the max cap and
instead break early in case too many jiffies expired.

I don't want to add sysctl knobs for this unless absolutely needed; its already
possible to 'force' eviction cycle by running 'conntrack -L'.
