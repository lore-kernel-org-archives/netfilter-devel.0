Hi David,

The following patchset contains a rather large update with Netfilter
fixes, specifically targeted to incorrect RCU usage in several spots and
the userspace conntrack helper infrastructure (nfnetlink_cthelper),
more specifically they are:

1) expect_class_max is incorrect set via cthelper, as in kernel semantics
   mandate that this represents the array of expectation classes minus 1.
   Patch from Liping Zhang.

2) Expectation policy updates via cthelper are currently broken for several
   reasons: This code allows illegal changes in the policy such as changing
   the number of expeciation classes, it is leaking the updated policy and
   such update occurs with no RCU protection at all. Fix this by adding a
   new nfnl_cthelper_update_policy() that describes what is really legal on
   the update path.

3) Fix several memory leaks in cthelper, from Jeffy Chen.

4) synchronize_rcu() is missing in the removal path of several modules,
   this may lead to races since CPU may still be running on code that has
   just gone. Also from Liping Zhang.

5) Don't use the helper hashtable from cthelper, it is not safe to walk
   over those bits without the helper mutex. Fix this by introducing a
   new independent list for userspace helpers. From Liping Zhang.

6) nf_ct_extend_unregister() needs synchronize_rcu() to make sure no
   packets are walking on any conntrack extension that is gone after
   module removal, again from Liping.

7) nf_nat_snmp may crash if we fail to unregister the helper due to
   accidental leftover code, from Gao Feng.

8) Fix leak in nfnetlink_queue with secctx support, from Liping Zhang.
