And anyway, you can guess it in many cases. I don't think there's a huge
problem, but you could of course just stash a global atomic somewhere to
keep track of how many of these you've made if that's easier for now.

Right. I think the quick solution is fine for 2.6.33. So that makes the
hashtable non-resize patch, the crash fix, and the cachep bits. I will
try to get involved and help you out with the per-ns hashtable clean
rather than just being a whiner :)

Thanks a bunch! Fedora kernels have already been built with this fix,
since it will allow us to close a fair number of "KVM goes boom" bugs.

Jon.
