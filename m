Oops, I'll fix that

Thanks I'll add that.

I do agree, I've also been searching for some icmp "lib" to use...

In  our case conntrack will not be there

I ran in to this issue in IPv6 testing so I got a little bit "paranoid".
Are you sure that the embedded IP and L4 header in the ICMP msg also is unfragmented.  
Is this true for both IPv6 & IPv4 ?

>From what I remember  when I was testing IPv6  icmp and digged into the original header (on a 2.6.32 kernel)  
pskb_may_pull was needed.

Good catch I'll do that,

When splitting get_hash()  above  will  be removed,  xt_action_param ->family will be used for selection.

hmmm 
kind of left overs,  Actually all "goto done" can be replaced by return 0

The IPv6 header recursion is not obvious, and it's hard to test all cases :-)

I really appreciate you review

Thanks
