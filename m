Without having seen your code, can we make it configurable on what
the bit is used for? Use of nulls marker is a strict requirement for
some targeted users of rhashtable.

If I understand this correctly we also need to block out parallel
walkers and we need to start taking bucket locks while walking to
modify the walker mark bit in peace.

That sounds like the best option to me.
