yes. blocking inserts would solve the problem, but it will make
rhashtable applicability to be limited.
Also 'count of pending inserts' is going to be very small and
meaningless, since it will count the number of threads that
are sleeping on insert and not very useful to predict future
expansions.
As an alternative we can store two chains of pointers
per element (one chain for old table and another chain
for future table). That will avoid all unzipping logic at the cost
of extra memory. May be there are other solutions.
I think as a minimum something like 'blocking inserts' are
needed for stable. imo the current situation with nft_hash
is not just annoying, it's a bug.
