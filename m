I refered to the document on "A Measurement Study of Packet Reception
using Linux"[1]  which said pf_ring maintains
a ring buffer, so we dont have to issue a receive system call for each
packet in contrast to AF_PACKET which issues a system call for each
packet(pls correct me if i am wrong).

I would like to know can we use AF_PACKET services from a kernel
module as we are not bound to pf_ring and can use
AF_PACKET if its efficient and easy to use?
