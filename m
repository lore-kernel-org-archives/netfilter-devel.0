This makes it hard for userspace to know whether insensitive
search is supported or not, similar for possible future flag
additions.

Please

- add a new revision for userspace to know whether flags are
   supported at all. You don't need to duplicate the checkentry
   function for this since the structure layout didn't change,
   you can simply parse flags dependant on match->revision.
   Userspace can use the existance of the new revision as
   indication that flags are supported.

- check for unknown flags and return an error
