Frames are dropped by conntrack, before TCP receiver can even have a
choice.

So Christoph patch would be of no use for Corey.

I do not think I shot anyone, only stated the truth.

We have workarounds in our stack to 'fix' bugs from others, there
is no shame in this.

Glad to see you are interested in RFC 5961 support, as conntrack is
known to break the ACK challenges in response to RST messages (section
