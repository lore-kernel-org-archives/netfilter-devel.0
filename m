You're right.  However, we can still do this without performing
another routing lookup.  The information is already there in the
fib rule.  We just didn't bother writing it down in the route for
forwarded packets.

So if we add a new field for the preferred source address to
struct rtable then we can avoid the lookup.

BTW, I'd still like to know the problem with the original oif key.
It's basically saying that if you can find the correct route using
the other keys (daddr/tos/mark) then all is well, if you can't
(dev != out) then we'll use the best address on the outgoing
interface.

Fortunately I'm one of those with lots of interfaces but only one
IP on each.  I can sympathise with your situation of many IPs but
only one interface :)
