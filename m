Yes, I just wanted to mention this in case someone thinks a sysctl is
must-have.

I did not want to add sysctl "just because" as we cannot easily rip
them out later.

Right, sorry.  So Eric suggested to leverage existing early demux.

This would work, but I found several disadvantages, namely it would:

1. only work for protocols that have early demux support
2. have to add some sort of new mini-sk to the "right" data
structure (udp_table, tcp_hashinfo) so not just af but l4 specific
handling
3. add more code to L4 protocol handlers
4. add some upper ceiling for such "forward sockets".
5. devise a scheme by which to zap the entry again

4+5 can be avoided by embedding the "forward sock" inside conntrack,
but that would mean we get larger code than this patch while still
retaining the conntrack dependency.

And without conntrack, I'm not sure how one would go about
adding such route cache without adding back all the problems it had.

Ok.  I can send a rebased V3.  OTOH, I don't want to rush things.

If you think further discussion is needed before deciding to go with
a conntrack-based route cache then lets do that.

In this case I can resend the v3 once next is open again plus a summary
of the alternatives/problems and we can take it from there.
