Yeah, if you're really worried about the cost of iptables =20
manipulations, you should probably write your own happy little C =20
program to atomically load, update, and store the rules.  Even then, =20
the cost of copying the whole ruleset to userspace for modification =20
is probably greater than that of memory allocation issues, especially =20
if the ruleset is large enough that memory allocation issues cause =20
problems :-D
