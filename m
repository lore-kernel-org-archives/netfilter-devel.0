 	If different containers can have different memory limit
we should restrict their memory with per-ns limits
and variables, i.e. DoS logic per-ns.

 	May be should be per-ns

 	Main points:

- May be we have to use global table for connections and to
filter by cp->net

- We have to use ip_vs_proto_data_get in many places where
pp = ip_vs_proto_get(protocol) was used. Then when pp
is needed we can use pd->pp->XXX

- tcp_timeout_change should work with the new struct ip_vs_proto_data
 	so that tcp_state_table will go to pd->state_table
 	and set_tcp_state will get pd instead of pp

- ipvs_skbnet must be used only for traffic after the
 	check for !skb_dst(skb)

 	Other notes:

rfc v2 01/10:
 	set_state_timeout: infrastructure is there but never added
 		to ipvsadm. If we keep it, it should be per-ns
 	Functions that can use cp->net and do not need argument:
 		ip_vs_conn_fill_cport
 		ip_vs_tcp_conn_listen
 		ip_vs_bind_app?
 		ip_vs_unbind_app
