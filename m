migrating route table entries makes no sense because
a) they refer to devices and configuration that does not exist in the
   target namespace; they only make sense within their netns context
b) they are purely virtual and you get the same result from deleting and
   recreating them.

Network devices are special because they may have something attached to
them, be it hardware or some daemon.
