That's certainly one possibility, however since we might have a huge
number of elements, its very undesirable to use even a little memory
for this.

I'm tending towards deferring resize operations while dumps are in
progress. Since we only allow dumps by root, it seems the worst
thing that can happen is that we run using a non optimal hash,
which is comparable to having a badly structured ruleset.
