The wrong abstraction is using a qdisc for ingress. An abstraction
is not about performance. Why do you thing ingress exists? For
queueing? Or as providing a hooking point for a bunch of broken
(at ingress) actions? You're (one of) the one who painfully realized
how broken any kind of packet mangling at that point is. The
infrastructure is simply crap and always has been.

Sorry, we are of the opinion that TC classifiers suck, so we will
not leave that path alone :) You're numbers are well appreciated,
we will fix this and return with better numbers.

I don't agree. It would be preferable to optimize the single hook
case not only for ingress's sake, but for all the already existing
hooks.
