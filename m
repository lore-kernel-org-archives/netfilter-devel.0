Yes, right now I'm fighting something which looks like double free
of conntrack during clone(CLONE_NEWNET)/exit test despite none created
in netns. And unknown to me dimensions of input and output packet codepaths.
:^)

Preliminaty details:
	struct nf_conn::ct_net which pins netns
	netns of expectation is netns of master conntrack by definition
	per-netns conntrack hash
	per-netns expect hash
	per-netns unconfirmed list
