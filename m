Thanks for your advices.
I will take your advice if I could have the opportunity
to write the final code.

As matter of factor, I trigger this bug when I tried to 
migrate H323 code to other operating systems.

This could trigger a panic because get_h2x5_addr functions
is the first time we ever try to ask for potentially
out of range data because of H323 style decodings 
(the value taddr->ipAddress.ip is decoded in the midway between
calling skb_header_pointer and calling get_h2x5_addr)
