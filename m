Yep ;)

By the way, you speak of a 'possible regression', but we always masked
BH while doing get_counters().

Only very recent kernels are masking them for each unit (cpu) of work.

There was attempt to use a lockless read for each counter (using a
seqlock), but it was not completed. I guess we could do something to
ressurect this idea.
