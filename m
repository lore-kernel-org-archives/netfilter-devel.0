Thanks, this looks good. One question:

Shouldn't NR_CPUs be replaced by nr_cpu_ids here? I'm wondering
why we still include NR_CPUs in the calculation at all though,
unlike in 2.4, we don't allocate one huge area of memory anymore
but do one allocation per CPU. IIRC it even was you who changed
that.
