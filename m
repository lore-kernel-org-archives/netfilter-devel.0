Well you have to consider the security aspect.  These days root-
only is no longer an acceptable excuse given things like namespaces.

If you don't fail the insertions while the expansion is ongoing,
and assuming a dump can postpone expansions, then you can essentially
insert entries into the hash table at will which is an easy DoS
attack.

Note that you don't have to fail the insertion right away.  I
think waiting until you reach max * 2 would be fine.
