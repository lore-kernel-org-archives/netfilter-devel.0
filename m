But it is the maximum "link level" singular header size.

It is MAX_HEADER which is the hack and the main issue.

What MAX_HEADER's setting is trying to do is optimistically allocate
enough for a single level of tunnelling.  It does not handle nested
tunneling at all, of course.

I like this idea for the most part.  It also deals nicely with, as you
alude to, how the MAX_HEADER scheme uses the space even if you don't
configure any tunnels at all.

Actually, I wonder how antiquated this all is.  I bet we could get rid
of MAX_HEADER, then if we have to realloc headroom, we adjust some
per-device header thing which will behave like your global value idea
does.  On the next allocation, we'll do the right thing.  Although I
cannot come up with a scheme that works without reintroducing another
net_device pointer to sk_buff, which seems necessary to handle arbitrary
nesting. :-/
