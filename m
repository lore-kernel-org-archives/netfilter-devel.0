Hi Jan,

Thanks a lot for your comments!

Great, so this will work.  I had checked the x_tables code and it seemed
that the lifetime of targinfo was sufficient, but I was not sure this
would be safe in the future.  Now, if this changes in the future, my
module won't be the only one to break ;)

I need to associate the timers with specific interfaces, because it's
the idle time of the interfaces that the userspace in interested in.  I
didn't find any other way to associate the timers with them, except by
looking at the iniface and outiface values in ipt_ip (and eventually,
with IPv6 properly implemented, in ip6t_ip6).  This is what Patrick
suggested when he checked my previous patch [1] and triggered me to do a
major rework on my module ;)

Do you have any other suggestion on how I can associate the rules to
specific interfaces?

Sure.  These remained there after I removed some traces.  I'll clean
this up.

Ok, I'll change it.  Thanks for pointing out.

Yup, will change.

Do you have any other suggestions on how I could get an interface
associated with the rule? I thought about having the userspace pass the
interface as an option to the rule (like I already do for the timeout
value), but that looked ugly to me, since the interface can already be
defined as part of the ruleset.

Ooops! I've redone this part of the code so many times and in this
version I completely forgot to include the outiface.  I'll fix it.

Yes.

I agree.  These names are coming from the original code.  I thought
about changing them to something clearer, but didn't bother to do it
yet, because I was focusing on the actual functionality.  I'll change
the names.

Again, thanks for your comments.  I'll rework and submit v2 soon.

Ah, and please excuse my lameness of mistyping the netdev email address
when I submitted the patch.  I fixed it now.
