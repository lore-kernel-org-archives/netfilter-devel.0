It also passes several interesting metainformation regarding the
packet to user-space as well. And it can be easily extended to add
more metainformation without breaking backward compatibility.

See nflog_get_physindev and nflog_get_physoutdev in libnetfilter_log.

This is a patch yet incomplete for libnetfilter_log:

http://1984.lsi.us.es/git/rlogd/tree/libnflog.patch

It allows you to print in LOG output format. It still need to add
support for UDP, UDPlite, and so on, but that shouldn't be hard to
make.

I'd be happy if someone takes it over and finish it.

Regarding Netfilter in general, I'd specifically would like to
move towards making as many things in user-space as we can (while
evaluting performance impact, of course). We're getting a nice set of
netlink interfaces that are allowing us this. Thus, the idea is to
follow hybrid architecture: provide generic infrastructure in
kernel-space (by means of netlink), then develop specific features in
user-space.

In that direction, I expect to come up with a user-space cthelper
infrastructure soon so we can also implement helpers in user-space.
