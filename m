We had this fix the otherday, because tcp prequeue code hit this check :

static inline struct dst_entry *skb_dst(const struct sk_buff *skb)
{
        /* If refdst was not refcounted, check we still are in a 
         * rcu_read_lock section
         */
        WARN_ON((skb->_skb_refdst & SKB_DST_NOREF) &&
                !rcu_read_lock_held() &&
                !rcu_read_lock_bh_held());
        return (struct dst_entry *)(skb->_skb_refdst & SKB_DST_PTRMASK);
}

Problem is the rcu protected pointer was escaping the rcu lock and was
then used in another thread.


What would be cool (but expensive maybe) , would be to get a cookie from
rcu_read_lock(), and check the cookie at rcu_dereference(). These
cookies would have system wide scope to catch any kind of errors.

Because a per thread counter would not catch following problem :

rcu_read_lock();

ptr = rcu_dereference(x);
if (!ptr)
	return NULL;
...


rcu_read_unlock();

...
rcu_read_lock();
/* no reload of x, ptr might be now stale/freed */
if (ptr->field) { ... }
