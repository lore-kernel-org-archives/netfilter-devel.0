And where can I read up on these best practices and how well they work?

In any case, these patches are all for the connection tracking helper,
which is needed unless you want to open up your firewall for every 
possible RTP source, in which case you can simply disable it. Some people 
are also using it to proritize RTP streams without any filtering.

Also, even if the NAT helper would not mangle packets, it is still needed 
to adjust expectations. so incoming connections can go to the correct
destination. That is, direct RTP connections between two endpoints
that didn't have any direct signalling communication before

You can of course also proxy everything through your SIP provider 
(including internal calls) and/or use STUN (which is unreliable under
Linux). I prefer not to.
