Okay.

Wondering if we should keep these cleanup changes to a separate patch.

Good catch, I'll re-add the NULL pointer check.

(notice that &ciph.len can get updated by ipv6_find_hdr())

I'm not sure I follow/understand.

I can see, that I don't handle the error cases of missing headers, from
a call to ipv6_find_hdr() ... I guess I need to check if the return
value "protocol" is negative.  But I'm not sure if it matters in this
case (Hans?)

I'm not sure what you want me to do?

Don't think its a "bug" in patch3, it might be a "bug" in this patch.
Because &ciph.len gets updated earlier by ipv6_find_hdr()... but I'm
starting to get confused.
Perhaps we should move these changes to ip_vs_in_icmp_v6() into the same
patch?

I'm not able to answer these questions, my self...

Yes, it seems that we will *only* see the reassembled packet (no
original fragments) after Patricks patches.  BUT *only* when loading the
module nf_conntrack_ipv6.


> Are we prepared to work in both ways (originals+reasm and
> just reasm) ?

As mentioned in another thread, no. But only because the reassembled
packet will be dropped due to the MTU check. After this is fixed, the
ipvs code seems to work. (Notice, this is both without and with my/these
patches)


> - For patch 3 in Kconfig do we need 'select NF_DEFRAG_IPV6' ?

Yes, but it is still possible not to load the module nf_defrag_ipv6.

When not loading, nf_defrag_ipv6, these patches have no effect, and no
fragments are passed through.

Yes, I think we should take Patrick's work into account.

My biggest concern is, that depending on which modules (nf_defrag_ipv6
only, or also nf_conntrack_ipv6) are loaded, different code paths are
used (to support IPv6 fragments for IPVS).
This will be hard to understand, from a user perspective.  And also
difficult for us, when users report bugs...

Is loading nf_conntrack_ipv6 considered a big performance problem/issue
for IPVS?
(Can we tell people, to enable conntrack for frag support?)
