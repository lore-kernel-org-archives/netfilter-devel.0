If you use TEE in PREROUTING or INPUT, teeing acts more like FORWARD th=
an
OUTPUT, though. All TEE does is lookup a route to a new fl.dst, but it =
keeps
the original src address in fl.src, so if somebody has some source-base=
d policy
routing, it could suddenly behave different. What do you think?

We are looking at a historic piece of code - and comments, which
traces back to when xt_NOTRACK was still in POM.

{
    =E2=86=92   /* Previously seen (loopback)? Ignore. */
    =E2=86=92   if ((*pskb)->nfct !=3D NULL)
    =E2=86=92       =E2=86=92   return IPT_CONTINUE;

    =E2=86=92   /* Attach fake conntrack entry.=C2=B7
    =E2=86=92      If there is a real ct entry correspondig to this pac=
ket,=C2=B7
    =E2=86=92      it'll hang aroun till timing out. We don't deal with=
 it
    =E2=86=92      for performance reasons. JK */
    =E2=86=92   (*pskb)->nfct =3D &ip_conntrack_untracked.infos[IP_CT_N=
EW];
    =E2=86=92   nf_conntrack_get((*pskb)->nfct);

    =E2=86=92   return IPT_CONTINUE;
}

Let's look at the condition "skb->nfct =3D=3D &tee_track.ct_general" in=
 detail. An
skb can only already have tee_track when it has been teed.

The teed packet however never traversed Xtables at all. Of course that =
changes
once the nesting patch is applied. But was someone really thinking of t=
his, 6
years ago?

That actually made me wonder and dig in history, and it turns out that
ipt_ROUTE allowed the packet to be fed back into netif_rx (commit
bee4e80167e3d024bdb80f400f4ecc8de47cfb03 in pom-ng.git), which would
explain all the loopback stuff. Since modern xt_TEE does not do
that evil thing, the comment is a walnut-hard remainder of past times.

I shall remove it now that it has been spotted.

The csum needs to be recomputed due to the addition of the DF flag.
