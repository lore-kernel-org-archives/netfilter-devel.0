Could we avoid this [NR_CPUS] thing ?

Did you tried :

static DECLARE_PER_CPU(struct lock_class_key, xt_locks_key);

static int __init xt_init(void)
 {
	unsigned int i;
	int rv;

	for_each_possible_cpu(i) {
		rwlock_t *lock =3D &per_cpu(xt_info_locks, i);

		rwlock_init(lock);
		lockdep_set_class(lock, &per_cpu(&xt_locks_key, i));
	}
=2E..

Thanks
