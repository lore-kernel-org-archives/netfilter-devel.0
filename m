Shouldn't be a big deal - assuming the mount is of a special type
for a network ns, we just record the objref for the checkpointed
network ns.  We don't need a namespace for the namespaces - we just
need unique names for the checkpoint image (the objref, which is
unique per netns).

Guess it really is about time that i work on some clean patches
for checkpoint/restart of mounts namespaces and mounts.
