Hans was tracking two bugs that I gave him some advice on.
The first was the threads keeping namespaces from exiting
at the proper time, which the first patch appears to almost
fix.  I didn't see the code in that to ensure the threads
were gone.

The second was a something that sounded like packets flying
around during network namespace subsys cleanup.  Simply
not having network devices and sockets open in the namespace
should be enough to guarantee you don't have packets flying
around.

My feeling is that the patches are in the right neighbourhood
but not quite there yet.

Eric
