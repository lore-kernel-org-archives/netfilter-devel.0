This is fine, but I'm wondering whether this can really fix the problem
you've been seeing. Before the packet is reallocated, the length of
nlmsglen - NLMSGLEN(0) - sizeof(struct ipq_peer_msg) is compared to
ipq_peer_msg->data_len, so both values need to be wrong.
ipq_peer_msg->data_len is a size_t, so it's unsigned.

I think what we should additionally do is verify that data_len < 65535
since that's the maximum size of an IP packet.

Using __GFP_NOWARN also makes sense in my opinion since ip_queue
prints a warning anyways and we return an errno code to userspace.
On second thought, we could also simply use GFP_KERNEL, AFAICS
packet reinjection does not happen in atomic context. I'll give
that a try.
