Hello,

netdev apparently ate my reply, but let me do a recap:

No, the pneigh_XXX() *is* the way to do RFC2461 proxying :)
I think Thaler's extended "proxy ARP" for IPv6 needs some other framework.

I still haven't had the time to check how proxy ARP really works in IPv4,
so I might have misunderstood this line in arp.c (line 763):

"(arp_fwd_proxy(in_dev, rt) || pneigh_lookup(&arp_tbl, &tip, dev, 0)))) {=
"

I think the first check is for proxy ARP, and the second for a router
acting as proxy.

In a similar case for IPv6, we would first need to check for the Thaler
IPv6 "proxy ARP", then for the RFC2461 router as a proxy case.

Well, we still need some way to have the router capture some packets (the
unicast NS messages) it would normally forward.>

How about this fix? I think it's cleaner than the one I proposed
earlier. The down side with it is that all nodes, no matter if they are
acting as proxies or not, will have to do some extra comparisons each tim=
e
they receive a packet.

Perhaps this is an acceptable trade off for the architectual cleannes
