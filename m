RFC-4443  "Every ICMPv6 message is preceded by an IPv6 header and zero or more IPv6 extension headers."
hdrlen is actually previous header length in bytes, to be correct.
nhoff is the sum of processed headers.
So in case of an icmp the nhoff will be updated, and hdrlen preset to ipv6hdr size

According to the RFC "Initialized to zero for transmission; ignored on reception"

True, it has a fixed size, of 8 octets
I'll fix that. 
(as long as it is zero it will work :-)

Ooops a "return XT_CONTINUE;" seems to be missing here.

with esp or ah the SPI will be used instead of ports.
Useful or not I don't know since they are asymmetric in terms of a flow.

problems with fragments...
But when looking into ipv6_skip_exthdr() again I realize that handling of 
NEXTHDR_HOP NEXTHDR_ROUTING, and NEXTHDR_DEST is wrong.

It think I need to rewrite this part a bit

just skip this headers;
	case NEXTHDR_HOP:
	case NEXTHDR_ROUTING:
	case NEXTHDR_DEST:
		break;

and exit on this:
	case NEXTHDR_IPV6:
	case	NEXTHDR_NONE:
	default:
		return XT_CONTINUE;
