I agree to that. The point here is to avoid unnecessary use of
NETLINK_F_DUMP_INTR if all entries fit into a single message buffer.

nl_table_lock was released between individual messages just like
ht->mutex is released with this change.

What changed is that inserts and removal can now occur *while* the
message is being constructed whereas previously they could only
occur between message construction periods. In either case, the dump
would end up missing entries or showing duplicates.
