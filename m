I see, that makes sense.

Yes, thats true. An alternative would be to have the ring frames dynamically
sized. The downside is that it increases overhead on the kernel side for
socket congestion control, currently its very easy to check whether the ring
is half empty, with dynamically sized frames we'd need to iterate through
the ring.

A further alternative would be to seperate the control and data areas, so
we'd have four rings, RX-control, RX-data, TX-control and TX-data. That would
avoid that problem, but it would only be partially dynamic since the number
of control frames would be constant.
