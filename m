It definately shows a stall, there are _no_ events between 0:53 and 1:11 
while there isn't any other period like that, every other minute since the 
start has some activity going on :-). So this might not be related to 
networking at all like we've kind of already figured out (definately 
accept() has very little to do here). There weren't close()'es there 
either so it looks very stuck on something that's outside of the syscalls 
we listed in -e, I suppose...

It seems that next sensible step is to just obtain a full strace to see 
what actually took place during those long minutes if anything (it's 
better that you keep that log private and just use grep over it on 
request). ...A full strace might grow huge though. Also, for strace use 
-tt instead of -t to get more accurate timestamps and add -T.

When you get the stall next time, please also check that the processes are 
actually sleeping instead of looping like crazy in some buggy userspace 
code :-) (obviously before resolving it with nmap).

When using nmap to resolve, take note on exact timestamp (including 
seconds). E.g., 
$ date > nmap.ts; nmap ...
