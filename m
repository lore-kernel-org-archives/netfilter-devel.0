Are there reproducer instructions available for this?

I don't see how TPROXY can be 'fixed' because when skb (tcp syn) is in
mangle PREROUTING nat transformation(s) have not been set up (yet).

So ip header addresses are all we have.

Only the ack (that finishes 3whs) or retransmitted syns will
have the post-nat address info available.

Ack should work fine with (changed) -m socket since the
socket should already be in the main ehash table.

Syn should also work just fine because Erics changes
should not affect initial listener lookup done by TPROXY.

If you already need NAT anyway you can also use -j REDIRECT (or exclude
tproxied packets from nat).
