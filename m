good point.  I  agree with the need for the exception, I would just
like it to be more explicit
in the code itself (like a turn off check around that particular
statement) so we do not have to
scrub thru the compiler output to filter out good / bad warning.
question:
  why do we not force the timestamp in the skb before going thru the
chain ? it looks to me
  that the check for (skb->tstamp.tv64 =3D=3D 0) should be done once
