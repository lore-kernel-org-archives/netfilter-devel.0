Most drivers call netif_receive_skb() from softirq handler

netif_rx() is used only on cases where we are in hard irq handler, or w=
e
want to avoid a recursion (tunnels for example)

To install a packet capture, you should take a look at dev_add_pack()
and friends [ net/packet/af_packet.c being a good reference ]
