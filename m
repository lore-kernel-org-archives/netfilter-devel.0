Yes I had to convert all my MASQUERADE rules over to SNAT due to this
problem.  Unfortunately I had to convert them back again because SNAT
doesn't do an automatic flush which MASQUERADE does.  Without the flush
it's pretty useless when your interface address changes often.

So it would be good to know why the oif key is a bad idea.

Cheers,
