Hi David,

The following patchset contains four updates for your net tree, they are:

* Fix crash on timewait sockets, since the TCP early demux was added,
  in nfnetlink_log, from Eric Dumazet.

* Fix broken syslog log-level for xt_LOG and ebt_log since printk format was
  converted from <.> to a 2 bytes pattern using ASCII SOH, from Joe Perches.

* Two security fixes for the TCP connection tracking targeting off-path attacks,
  from Jozsef Kadlecsik. The problem was discovered by Jan Wrobel and it is
  documented in: http://mixedbit.org/reflection_scan/reflection_scan.pdf.

You can pull these changes from:

git://1984.lsi.us.es/nf master

Thanks!
