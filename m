No worries.

The unsigned long return is kind of odd with a
compare_<foo> name as those are generally, as Jan
mentioned, signed comparison style return values.

I'd probably use a different function name too

bool ifname_equal(const char *a, const char *b, const char *mask)
{
}

to try to make the return value more obvious too.
