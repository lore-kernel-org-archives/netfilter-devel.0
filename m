You make it quite hard to give reasonable feedback to your code :-/
First you attack me personally here, then - 30 minutes later - in 
the next iteration of your patch, you do:

+       /* wait for each other cpu to see new table */
+       for_each_possible_cpu(i)
+               if (i != smp_processor_id()) {
+                       xt_info_wrlock(i);
+                       xt_info_wrunlock(i);
+               }

... which i have not seen in your previous patch and which looks 
awfully similar to the write_lock_wait() based primitive i 
suggested.

( Just open-coded in an ugly fashion and slower than a real, proper
  wait-unlock would be, because it dirties all those locks 
  needlessly. )

So you must have agreed with me to a certain degree - i just dont 
see that in any of the discussion. (you seem to totally disagree 
with me to the level of ridiculing me.) Which makes it hard to 
discuss this on a rational basis.

> Your version fails for the case of nested local rules. [...]

Yes, as Eric pointed it out, more than an hour before your reply. I 
find the nesting uninteresting (in fact i find it harmful - see my 
reply to Eric). If you were only interested in nesting then a plain 
old-fashioned rwlock would have done the job.

The detail that is interesting here is how to avoid the global 
rwlock cacheline bounce - not the recursion. (the same-CPU recursion 
is avoidable via proper design or workaround-able via a counter in 
so many ways)

Anyway, i'm back into lurker mode.
