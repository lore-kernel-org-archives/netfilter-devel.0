So this situation uses SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU to quickly recycle deleted
elements?  (Not obvious from the code, but my ignorance of the networki=
ng
code is such that many things in that part of the kernel are not obviou=
s
to me, I am afraid.)

Otherwise, of course you would simply allow deleted elements to continu=
e
pointing where they did previously, so that concurrent readers would no=
t
miss anything.

Of course, the same potential might arise on insertion, but it is usual=
ly
OK to miss an element that was inserted after you started searching.

Ah...  Is there also a resize operation?  Herbert did do a resizable
hash table recently, but I was under the impression that (1) it was in
some other part of the networking stack and (2) it avoided the need to
restart readers.

Or maybe the DoS attack is injecting so many new conntracks that a larg=
e
fraction of the hash chains are being modified at any given time?
