Correct; I can tell from experience with pam_mount. GDM for example is 
very unhappy if you fork/exit processes in PAM modules and don't hide 
the fact by bending SIGCHLD from gdm_handler to mypam_handler (which 
itself is racy, suppose GDM re-set the SIGCHLD handler midway through).

(In this particular case however, I'd prefer if login programs like GDM 
just ignored any PIDs they did not spawn in the first place instead of 
moaning around.)
