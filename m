No. While you sure could associate routes with devices, they don't
*functionally* reside on top of network devices. They reside on top of
the entire IP configuration, and in case of BGP they even reside on top
of your set of peerings and their data.

Even if you could "move" routes together with a network device, the
result would be utter nonsense. The routes depend on your BGP view, and
if your set of interfaces (and peers) changes, your routes will change.
Your bgpd will, either way, need to set up new peerings and redo best
path evaluations.

(On an unrelated note, how often are you planning to move stuff between
namespaces? I don't expect to be moving stuff except on configuration
events...)
