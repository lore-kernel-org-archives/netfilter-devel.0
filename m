I've used pure transport mode SAs in a couple of cases and I do feel
they're important to support, and would really like to be able to use
firewall rules with them too..  In fact, I'd think it'd be more
important with transport-mode because it's more likely you'll want to
set up a pretty open use-ipsec-whenever-possible-with-remote-hosts mode,
unlike with tunnel mode where it's more likely you'll set up specific
policies which only accept tunnels which go to certain ports on certain
IPs, etc.  At least, I've set that up as well... :)

	Thanks,
