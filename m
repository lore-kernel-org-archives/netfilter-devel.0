I like it .. kind of like routing realms. For your specific case there
is a possible solution already supported by the kernel, you can
pre-allocate ppp devices using PPPIOCNEWUNIT, rename them and later
attach to individual units in the ppp daemon using PPPIOCATTACH
(I have a patch for this somewhere if you're interested). But that
only works for PPP devices and the group idea looks more flexible.
