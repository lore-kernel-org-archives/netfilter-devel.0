I think I have the LOG target compiled into the kernel. After the echo, I got
this within a matter of seconds:

   printk: 614 messages suppressed.
   ip_ct_tcp: bad TCP checksum IN= OUT= SRC=xxxxxxxxxxxx DST=84.56.231.206 LEN=105 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=53 ID=33989 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=119 DPT=41349 SEQ=495763142 ACK=177548929 WINDOW=56677 RES=0x00 ACK PSH URGP=0 OPT (0101080A0986EF9D00E16123) 

This is interesting, as the connection in question seems to work fine (at
least I can download news at 32kb/s, which is the rate limit on the other
side without much more than 32kb/s on my ppp link, so it is weird that
this many packets should have invalid tcp checksum. Maybe this is somehow
related?)

I then tried to create a masqueraded connection and got the expected
symptoms: correctly re-written packet leaves interface, return packet gets
RST.

During that time, I got more of the above messages, but none related to the
test connection.

I then stopped all traffic-generating programs to get an idle link and
retried. Still no log messages from the test conenction.

No messages, either.

(As I wrote in another mail), I also found in the meantime that switching
off SACK only results in a correct handshake, further packets might and
usually will cause a RST.

I hope that trying with 2.6.11, and getting the same problem (as I did in
the meantime), is even better than testing 2.6.12.5.

The weird thing is that it works on tap, but not on ethernet/ppp. Maybe
the kernel code gets some offset wrong?
