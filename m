This case might be different in that a normal firewall use case
probably doesn't have more than 16 cpus, even than would be quite
a lot. So for bigger machines this is probably more about keeping
the "non-use" costs low.

I'll keep it in mind though and I'm interested in seeing how it
turns out in the long term :)
