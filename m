No - the original usecase was task teardown: I still remembered that but didn't 
find the commit - but it's there in very old Linux kernel patches, done by DaveM 
originally in v2.1.36 (!):

+#endif


Other code learned to use spin_unlock_wait(): the original version of 
[hard]irq_enter() was the second user, net_family_read_lock() was the third user, 
followed by more uses in networking. All but one of those are not present in the 
current upstream kernel anymore.

This task-teardown FIXME was fixed in v2.1.114 (was replaced by an open coded poll 
loop), but the spin_unlock_wait() primitive remained.

The rest is history! ;-)

Thanks,

	Ingo
