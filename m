Hi Pablo,

I guess that it is too late in the cycle to get this fix into v3.9.
If so could you please consider it for v3.10.

I would also like the patch considered for stable. It seems to be applicable
to all kernel releases since the sip persistence engine was added
by my in v2.6.37. In particular I have checked that it applies cleanly to:

3.8.8 stable
3.4.41 longterm
3.2.43 longterm
3.0.74 longterm

The following changes since commit 60d509fa6a9c4653a86ad830e4c4b30360b23f0e:
