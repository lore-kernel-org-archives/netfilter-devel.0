One option would be to make it more robust for such use. The 
downside would be all the other cases where the expression is really 
constant (but still takes a few instructions to calculate) and could 
be (and should be) evaluated outside of that critical section.

So i'd tend to leave it in its current (optimistic) form: we've got 
1283 uses of spin_lock_bh(), and just a quick look at git grep 
suggests that the current optimistic optimization matters in 
practice.
