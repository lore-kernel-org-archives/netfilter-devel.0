I had a look at current conntrack and found the 'unconfirmed' list was
maybe a candidate for a potential blackhole.

That is, if a reader happens to hit an entry that is moved from regular
hash table slot 'hash' to unconfirmed list, reader might scan whole
unconfirmed list to find out he is not anymore on the wanted hash chain=
=2E

Problem is this unconfirmed list might be very very long in case of
DDOS. It's really not designed to be scanned during a lookup.

So I guess we should stop early if we find an unconfirmed entry ?
