The original idea was that if the input route relookup sends us
to a different device, something is very strange.

Input routing looks up using daddr/saddr/tos as the key.  The change
here is that we're now using the fwmark, so you're right that only
policy routing can cause this thing to trigger.

Where did this check some from?  From this change below, and the
changelog explains why we do things this way.

I know you don't use BK Harald, but things like this are why you should
at least use the web based interface to look at file change history.

#    the things a lot. In this context, if you want to be sure that packet
#    will go out expected interface you do plain lookup and drop packet
#    if it gave you some strange route.
