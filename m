	Yes, currently, both ip_vs_nat_icmp_v6 callers use
skb_make_writable before calling it.

	Yes, patch-4 is not needed.

	No, this comment is for patch-5 where 2 ipv6_find_hdr
calls are added to ip_vs_nat_icmp_v6. But we can change it
later in followup patch as an optimization.

	Sorry, this is for patch-5, its purpose is for
skb_make_writable in ip_vs_icmp_xmit_v6, not for debug.

	Good idea, this is its purpose.

	Yes, it was in this way at 2 places before your changes,
one in handle_response_icmp and another in ip_vs_in_icmp_v6.

	For the record, this is patch-7

	Agreed, NULL for flags looks fine.

	The initialization is risky but saves stack. So,
it is up to you to decide whether we need local ipvsh_stack
var as before patch-7.
