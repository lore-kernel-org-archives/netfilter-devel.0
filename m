The idea is that there will be one sk_filter_cb per socket filtering
approach. The structure module is just there in case one of the
approach is loadable as kernel module, it's the typical code pattern
in the kernel. You can git grep for similar code.

This is extracted from one of your recent patches:

 void sk_filter_uncharge(struct sock *sk, struct sk_filter *fp)
 {
-       atomic_sub(sk_filter_size(fp->len), &sk->sk_omem_alloc);
+       if (!fp->ebpf)
+               atomic_sub(sk_filter_size(fp->len), &sk->sk_omem_alloc);
        sk_filter_release(fp);
 }

 void sk_filter_charge(struct sock *sk, struct sk_filter *fp)
 {
        atomic_inc(&fp->refcnt);
-       atomic_add(sk_filter_size(fp->len), &sk->sk_omem_alloc);
+       if (!fp->ebpf)
+               atomic_add(sk_filter_size(fp->len), &sk->sk_omem_alloc);
 }

Basically, that looks to me like two different socket filtering
approach. You only have to define the struct sock_filter_cb, set the
fields to point to the functions and register the approach in the
socket filtering engine. That will allow a simple way to look up the
filtering approach when loading the filter from userspace.

By quick git grepping you already can find clients of this that do not
need rcu / refcount: cls_bpf.c, net_cls.c, xt_bpf.c and
ptp_classifier.  Moreover, I only see the refcnt bumped from
sk_filter_charge(), I didn't find it neither in git nor in your
patches. I don't think rcu_head and refcnt are really part of the
filter *in any case*, they just provide the way to link/unlink objects
in a safe way in some situations.

By renaming this, you're not fixing up things the semantics. It seems
to me you just want to find a quick path to solve inconsistencies in
your code.
