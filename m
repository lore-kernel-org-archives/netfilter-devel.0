True, Jesper pointed out the same thing to me.

Good point.  Indeed, this can be global.  I did not increase it
since more locks than tree slots is illegal (need exclusive access to
each rtree at this time). I guess we could align it or increase number
of lock and rbtree slots (after moving lock slots out of connlimit
data).

Thanks for the heads-up Eric, I'll see about addressing this later this
week if noone beats me to it.
