So we have two adjacent entries on the same chain that perform the exact
same action.  We delete one of them.

I do not see how that is noticable.  Registration order plays a small
role but especially with the priority bit we don't strongly honor
registration order.

In your example above we will distinguish between the two chains
as nf_hook_ops->priv will point the nf tables chain.   So that specific
case is at least safe.

I don't believe that is necessary.  To the best of my knowledge for a
registration to be meaningful we must always change at least one of
those fields I am comparing.  Typically either priv or hook.

It is a real change from what we have been doing but there is a lot
of freedom in not needing to keep the original structure around.
