Everywhere? No, one small village of indomitable Gauls.^^^^^^^^W

Same suffix? Certainly not with contemporary configurations (and
Linux did this quite on its own there). In fact, now that there is
almost v6-NAT in the kernel, I fear that users who are blinded by NAT
now make the problem worse by actually feeding perfectly good Privacy
Extension Addresses into a n:1-configured SNAT/MASQUERADE target
instead of a NETMAP.
