I think it's reasonable to assume that --nflog-range from the rule
applies globally to any instance.

However, per-instance copy_range has prevailed over --nflog-range
since the beginning, so I would follow a more conservative approach,
ie. remain copy_range in preference over --nflog-range.

So I'd suggest you invert this logic.

Let me know, thanks.
