We've talked about this a few times, but we have some pretty deep
call chains especially in ctnetlink, which are using sleeping
allocations. Not sure whether we really want to convert those.
An alternative would be to push locking down one level and have
the subsystem decide whether to use RCU or the mutex. However that
would require taking a reference to the subsystem in nfnetlink to
avoid module unloda races.

That sounds pretty impressive.
