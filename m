More than feasible.   Look at cgroup's network stack work.   Stick
each user in there own Cgroup and they can even have there own IP
number and table if they like.   Of course cannot effect the table
outside the Cgroup.   Its the one of the major reasons why I said
fixing up netfilter to provide what is required makes doing multi user
simple.

Rules there would only be a extension to what cgroup networking and
netfilter.  Yes no LSM involvement required.

There are many ways though the Linux kernel.  This is part of the
reason why I am asking why they are wanting LSM so much.  LSM was
decided to be only one thing.   Not something to make more of if it
can be avoided.   First rule should be seeing if API and Internal
structs of Linux need fixing.  This case yes there are quite a few
weaknesses in netfilter that could do with fixing.   If after fixing
netfilter up it still turns out you need LSM support then you do have
a valid reason.

Bind not blocking is a defect in netfilter.   Bind call informs
netfilter that the traffic to that location is wanted.   One problem
netfilter cannot answer blocked.   Bind is not a LSM issue really.
Its a API issue between bind and netfilter.   Currently netfilter just
cuts the traffic off on the other side.  Ie you have binded to a port
and will receive nothing because no traffic will get to you.  Its also
not per application its global.    Yes netfilter rules store the
information need for blocking bind just no way of informing
application that it is.
