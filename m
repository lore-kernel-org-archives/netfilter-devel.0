As a side note, Jenkins performs nearly optimally (unlike
most traditional hash functions) with power of two hash
table sizes.

Using a pow2 hash table size would completely obviate the
issues solved by #2.

I don't know if that is feasible here in xt_hashlimit, but
if it is that is how we should solve this expensive
modulo.
