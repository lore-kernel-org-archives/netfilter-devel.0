Resizing might also fail because of memory allocation problems, but
I'd argue that its better to continue with a non-optimal sized table
and retry later than to completely fail, at least unless the API
user has explicitly requested this behaviour.

As for the element counter, yeah, it should prevent overflow. In that
case I agree that failing insertion is the easiest solution.
