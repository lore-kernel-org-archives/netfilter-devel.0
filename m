Well, I hope IPVS people will take care of this.  I don't really know
that code too well...

I just ran into Marcel Holtmann earlier today.  He thinks moving that
data into the cb is fine, though he has to double-check that.

He also said that he really only needs 5 bits, so even if the current
pkt_type overloading would persist, we could probably shrink it to make
space for the IPVS bit.
