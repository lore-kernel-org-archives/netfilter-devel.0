Hi David,

Second version including requested updates.

The following patchset contains the Netfilter updates for net-next.
Most notably:

* The new /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_helper entry that
  allows to disable the automatic conntrack helper assignment from
  Eric Leblond. This patch also spots a warning to inform the user
  that this behaviour will be removed at some point. The automatic
  conntrack helper assignment may allows attackers to open hole in
  the firewall to access the protected network segments (with
  incorrect configurations). More information on this issue at:

  https://home.regit.org/netfilter-en/secure-use-of-helpers/

  In the near future, all conntrack helpers will be explicitly
  attached via the CT target, as we longing discussed during
  the last netfilter workshop.

* One new sysctl to translate the input device to vlan device name
  from Florian Westphal. He required this to get the REDIRECT target
  working with another sysctl vlan-on-top-of-bridge.

* Major improvements in the ip_vs_sync code from Julian Anastasov.
  They aim to improve scalability and to address possible message
  loss due to socket overrun under high rate of synchronization
  messages.

* Several minor memory allocation flags fixes from IPVS people
  contributors.

* Eric Leblond's patch spotted one problem that becomes noticeable
  if a) automatic helper assignment is disabled, and b) if NAT is
  in use, and c) the CT target is used to attach a non-standard
  conntrack helper port. This fix comes from myself.

* One small update to allow updating the expectation timeout from
  Kelvie Wong.

* Finally, remove ip[6]_queue support since they have been marked
  as obsolete since long time ago. Now, we have nfnetlink_queue
  which is way more flexible from myself.

You can pull these changes from:

git://1984.lsi.us.es/net-next master

If time allows, I'd like to send a second batch. There a several patches
that are very close to get into shape still on netfilter-devel.

Thanks!
