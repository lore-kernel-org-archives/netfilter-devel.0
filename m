True.  That's why I was using netdevice_notifiers , so that I would
monitor the interface state and add the idletimer attribute when a timer
was associated with the interface that went up.  But now the rules are
not interface specific, so it cannot be done like that anymore.

Okay, so this can be done in either place.  I tend to
prefer /sys/class/net/idletimer.

What about my other proposal of creating generic timers and associating
them with certain interfaces whenever we get a hit? I mean, to add the
idletimer attribute to eg. /sys/class/net/wlan0/idletimer when a packet
reaches the target from wlan0?
