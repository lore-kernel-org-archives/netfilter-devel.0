Agreed.

This connection exists today in the form of marking. Let conmtracking
mark then use fw classifier at the qdisc. If i am not mistaken theres
something more powerful these days called conmarking.
Now if you did it like that then you dont need Haralds code and it will
be much easier to maintain (refer to my earlier email).

Contracking is a horrible performance pig. I dont even turn it on. Dont
make it a requirement to turn it on.

Heres a thought:
Make it a tc action.
--> netfilter: contrack --> conmark
--> qdisc: classify via fw -> billing action bill
-------->                      attach table index + lock to skb

on skb freeing make sure you delete the index and lock.
On cloning, what to do?

Note i do plan to have a contracking action at the qdisc level.
Let me know if that is useful to you then i can prioritize.

Possibly yes.

I think it does. Make sure you double check the rules i posted earlier.
