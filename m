I grabbed this lot, so it will turn up in linux-next soon.

There are quite a lot of clients of the crc32 code.  net, netfilter and
wireless are prominent, but there are others everywhere.

So I cc'ed various other mailing lists just as a heads-up that this
work is inbound and will hopefully yield performance improvements.  But
of course, it might also yield bugs.
