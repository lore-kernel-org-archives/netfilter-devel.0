I think its plausable, there is a lot of modification going on.
Approx 40.000 deletes/sec and 40.000 inserts/sec.
The hash bucket size is 300032, and with 80000 modifications/sec, we are 
(potentially) changing 26.6% of the hash chains each second.

As can be seen from the graphs:
  http://people.netfilter.org/hawk/DDoS/2010-04-12__001/list.html

Notice that primarily CPU2 is doing the 40k deletes/sec, while CPU1 is 
caught searching...

Guess I have to reproduce the DoS attack in a testlab (I will first have 
time Tuesday).  So we can determine if its bad hashing or restart of the 
search loop.


The traffic pattern was fairly simple:

200 bytes UDP packets, comming from approx 60 source IPs, going to one 
destination IP.  The UDP destination port number was varied in the range 
of 1 to 6000.   The source UDP port was varied a bit more, some ranging 
from 32768 to 61000, and some from 1028 to 5000.
