Hi Pablo,

please consider this fix IPVS fix for v3.17.

This pull request is based on the first round of fixes for IPVS for v3.17,
tagged as ipvs-fixes2-for-v3.17, which I sent yesterday.


This fix resolves a problem with conflicting hooks whereby DNAT support for
the local server would drop outgoing IPv4 packets if the kernel was
compiled CONFIG_IP_VS_IPV6=y.

This problem dates back to v3.6.37 when the feature in question was added.

I would like this fix considered for -stable.
