Could be, technically.

Is there devgroup support in libvirt, ifcfg, whatever other distros use for 
their static interface configuration? Or, do I again have to write pre/post 
scripts to set devgroups? Wouldn't bother me too much nowadays, I've automated 
that for ifcfg style stuff in my production environment a year ago, but it's 
something an admin must actively manage...

There is other stuff, apart from libvirt, that creates and destroys interfaces 
on the fly. From my production environment, there's at least keepalived, which 
creates macvlan interfaces on the fly for VRRP VMAC support. I can configure 
the name for that, but nothing else, nor can I call a script pre/post for 
that. And my iptables rules on that boxen _do_ match specially on these 
interfaces.

Gooling a bit around does not immediately turn up any good documentation on it 
at all (four year old iproute2 commits, once I give that as a search term 
too?). Looks very sketchy (although the fundamental idea is clear to me. I'm 
looking through the normal admin practise lens....)

best regards
