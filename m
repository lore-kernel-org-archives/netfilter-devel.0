I don't remember any recent discussions on libc-alpha, or any bug
reports about this concrete change.

(Redirecting to libc-alpha, which seems the more appropriate list.)

My impression is that this inconsistency isn't the only problem.  The
problems start if application developers need functionality which is
only in kernel-provided headers, but they still need to include glibc
headers at the same time.

That could be helpful.

I'm not familiar with relevant developer practices.  It seems to me that
from an application developer point of view, kernel headers are updated
a bit more frequently than glibc headers.  This likely pushes the
solution into a certain direction (and may be the rationale behind the
kernel's libc-compat.h).
