A couple of things:
- You don't check skb_dst() first thing in all hooks.

- All hooks have state->net after my changes so it gets
  a lot easier.

- I am trying to avoid dev_net(skb_dst(skb)->dev) if I can
  because of my ulterior motive of allowing a destination
  network device in another network namespace.

Agreed.  sock_net is the right thing for the netlink sockets,
and while obscured by skb_sknet that works fine.

Yes I have seen that.

And I have seen this.

Interesting I had not thought of changing ip_vs_iphdr.

I actually have a patch that passes state->net down to where it is
needed or uses ip_vs_conn_net() and it it looks ok, but the patch
is so busy with small tweaks that I need to break it up.

Further I am staring at things and trying to see if there is a way to
make the mass of parameters more readable/obvious.   Something like
the passing of struct nf_hook_state into the netfilter hooks.

Or in other words I want to make the change to ip_vs deadly boring,
obviously correct, and trivial to maintain, and I am not quite there
yet.

Eric

p.s.  I do have my patch that I can toss in your direction if you are
interested.
