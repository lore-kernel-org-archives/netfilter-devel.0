MASQUERADE leaves packets with saddr=0.0.0.0 pass without SNAT.
So that might be the reason. Another possibility is that these
packets match an existing connection, the NAT table only sees
the first packet of each connection. Third option would be
invalid IP headers, but you'd see a message in that case.
