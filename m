I found where the problem is. This is the userspace code for libpcap:

        do {
                len = recv(handle->fd, handle->buffer, handle->bufsize, 0);
                if (handle->break_loop) {
                        handle->break_loop = 0;
                        return -2;
                }
        } while ((len == -1) && (errno == EINTR));

       ...

        buf = handle->buffer;
        while (len >= NLMSG_SPACE(0)) {
                const struct nlmsghdr *nlh = (const struct nlmsghdr *) buf;
                u_int32_t msg_len;
                nftype_t type = OTHER;

                if (nlh->nlmsg_len < sizeof(struct nlmsghdr) || len <
nlh->nlmsg_len) {
                        snprintf(handle->errbuf, PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE,
"Message truncated: (got: %d) (nlmsg_len: %u)", len, nlh->nlmsg_len);
                        return -1;
                }

handle->bufsize is only big enough to accommodate the snaplen specified
by the user in dumpcap. So if we send more data than that then we will
break userspace. One way around this is to send min(li->u.ulog.copy_len,
inst->copy_range). If this is OK then I can send a patch for this,
please suggest.
