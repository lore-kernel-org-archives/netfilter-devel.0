I'm not sure if I understand that, how could this be used to know if
BRIDGE_NETFILTER was configured?

indev->br_port->br->dev->ifindex points to the ifindex of the bridge br0
when indev is a bridge port (eth0). So you need this to fill in the
input device (assuming we agree that the bridge is called the input
device, and the bridge port is called the physical input device).
Filling in the physical input device is done with indev (in case
indev->br_port is not NULL).

I can't easily get access to net-2.6.14, so I can't have a full view on
things. If you were to change ebt_ulog, you must also make sure that the
physindev is used for NFULA_IFINDEX_PHYSINDEV. The input_dev member of
the skb will be eth0 if the physindev is known.

Analogous comments hold for the other similar parts of your patch.

cheers,
Bart
