Since you suspect the problem is being caused by a broken middlebox,
would it perhaps be a better approach to add a per-route option to
allow disabling of FRTO for the given destination.  This would be
similar to Stephen Hemminger's fix for broken middleboxes that don't
handle window scaling properly.  It seems this would be better than
modifying FRTO behavior for everyone else that is being compliant.

A question then arises is if the bogus scenario has a TCP signature
that could be used to print a warning message for the unsuspecting
user so they could then take necessary corrective action.
