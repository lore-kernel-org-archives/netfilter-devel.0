Well, if the found socket happens to be a LISTEN socket, we ignore the
socket if it was bound to 0.0.0.0

Thats the wildcard thing in xt_socket. Not clear why its there, but
thing is : we apparently have to keep this behavior by default.

So yes, the ACK packet from the client is not matched by current
xt_socket.

After my patch, it is matched.

I CCed you because you mentioned using conntrack for SYN filtering :
xt_socket can be a way to do the same thing without the conntrack
overhead, for locally terminated traffic.
