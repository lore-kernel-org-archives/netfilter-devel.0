If only that were the case :)

Doesn't work because we're trying to get the correct source address from
the routing lookup.

The problem is that we don't record the preferred source in struct rtable.
It is available in the original FIB rule.  So by adding a new field in
struct rtable we should be able to avoid this lookup.

Absolutely.

Well I took that advice and ended up with tons of broken systems because
SNAT is totally broken when your IP address is dynamic.  MASQUERADE
flushes the conntrack rules automatically.  SNAT does not.
