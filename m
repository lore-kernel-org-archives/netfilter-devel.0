We don't have a good answer for resources which are shared across
different cgroups.  It is often too expensive to track such sharing
accurately and crude approximation (creator-owned, last-used or
whatever) is used widely even outside cgroup.  Different cgroup
controllers tried different approaches but most are settling down for
creator ownership with exceptions for high impact cases.

I don't think there's a solution which satifies all cases here.  Given
that, doing the minimum amount of work (not worrying about SCM_RIGHTS
transfers) is the right thing to do, but we've had this re-labeling
since 2012, so leaving as-is is likely the best option at this point.

Thanks.
