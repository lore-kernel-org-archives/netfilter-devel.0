No, that won't be possible if we have more than one SA and
would also make DNAT in LOCAL_OUT on the encapsulated packet
impossible.

What I propose is to keep tunnel mode handling as it is, so
for each tunnel mode SA we hit PRE_ROUTING and LOCAL_IN in
the normal packet path. If the final SA is a transport mode
SA, we don't call netif_rx as in my first patchset, but pass
the packet through a new PRE_ROUTING hook in xfrm{4,6}_input
and LOCAL_IN afterwards. The packet won't be processed a second
time by the stack, just the netfilter hooks will be called.
NAT be will be handled manually for IPv4 by doing a new route
lookup and calling dst_input if NAT took place.
