Hi David,

This patchset contains four nf_tables fixes, one IPVS fix due to
missing updates in the interaction with the new sedadj conntrack
extension that was added to support the netfilter synproxy code,
and a couple of one-liners to fix netnamespace netfilter issues.
More specifically, they are:

* Fix ipv6_find_hdr() call without offset being explicitly initialized
  in nft_exthdr, as required by that function, from Daniel Borkmann.

* Fix oops in nfnetlink_log when using netns and unloading the kernel
  module, from Gao feng.

* Fix BUG_ON in nf_ct_timestamp extension after netns is destroyed,
  from Helmut Schaa.

* Fix crash in IPVS due to missing sequence adjustment extension being
  allocated in the conntrack, from Jesper Dangaard Brouer.

* Add bugtrap to spot a warning in case you deference sequence adjustment
  conntrack area when not available, this should help to catch similar
  invalid dereferences in the Netfilter tree, also from Jesper.

* Fix incomple dumping of sets in nf_tables when retrieving by family,
  from me.

* Fix oops when updating the table state (dormant <-> active) and having
  user (not base ) chains, from me.

* Fix wrong validation in set element data that results in returning
  -EINVAL when using the nf_tables dictionary feature with mappings,
  also from me.

We don't usually have this amount of fixes by this time (as we're already
in -rc5 of the development cycle), although half of them are related to
nf_tables which is a relatively new thing, and I also belive that holidays
have also delayed the flight of bugfixes to mainstream a bit.

Thanks!

P.S: Have a nice entrance to new year.
