	Just to clarify that both patches for ip_vs_ftp are
only for code that come in 2.6.36-rc, 2.6.35 is ok and does
not need them.

	The other problem is that 2.6.36-rc comes with
requirement IPVS to keep netfilter conntracks for all
connections, eg. DirectRouting, not only for LVS-NAT (ip_vs_ftp).
I have a bigger patch to make the IPVS conntracking support
an option (enabled by default only for ip_vs_ftp) but
may be it is not appropriate for -rc series. So, for now
we are fixing just the fatal problems but the risk of
IPVS setups with low nf_conntrack_max value to stop
processing high loads remains without making the conntrack
support an option. Before now all conntracks were created
and destroyed for every packet and nf_conntrack_max,
even if low, probably is never reached.
