Sure, but that still doesn't explain at all why the expected traffic 
doesn't show up anywhere (ie., the working mail after nmap resolution). 
Such a router cannot prevent us tcpdumping both ends. My point is that we 
would always see the packet at least in the sending end's tcpdump. And, 
would we have the traffic from the end-point tcpdumps, we could trivially 
figure out what the middlebox did to the traffic.

Agreed, it shouldn't happen. Do you have a static setup for the IPs or is 
there dhcp component which could in theory cause some routing table 
alterations, again I find that unlikely but in the meantime I start to run 
out of ideas how the client and server can speak with each other without 
leaving any traces about it (I hope you really used exactly the tcpdump 
command you told in the mail linking to those stall logs).

There's some NAT somewhere btw because the client uses 192.168.0.2 as 
source address but I don't think that currently has some relevance (it 
might timeout some connections after an idle period, which is usually
of configurable length).
