Sorry for not adding that one, I think you sent that email after I
finished writing the summary and that's why it wasn't included in the
first place.
This is another way of doing it, yes, but in the end we would probably
end up writing additional wrapper like code with the only purpose of
being called by <insert favorite LSM here> and then forwarding that call
to <insert favorite personal firewall here>.
To have multiple approaches working we would probably need
register/unregister functions for that wrapper and, to be honest, to me
this sounds like a more complicated version of doing the calls to the
wrapper directly from net/socket.c. The outcome is pretty much the same
though.

I can only agree on that. However, providing a single solution that
cannot be extended dynamically (think of adding support for additional
protocols, implementing some sort of policy caching, etc.) might be the
wrong way to go.
We would end up having a solution and whilst I really like the snet
approach we would lose some flexibility.
This very approach on the other hand seems to work very well for
netfilter and we would end up with keeping all those personal firewall
developers out of the kernel.
