Almost. I just wanted to leave in place struct sk_filter for the
coming up generalization, that structure should contain the refcnt,
rcu_head and the struct bpf_prog after some of your follow up patches.
Please, also leave sk_filter_charge/uncharge/get_filter whatever will
provide the room the generalization under net/core/filter.c, not need
to move these to kernel/bpf/

After my patch (and your follow up), we don't have sloppy usage of
rcu_head for unattached filter anymore and I guess Willem is going to
same save bytes in his iptables/bpf rules given that he can directly
use bpf_prog instead of sk_filter.
