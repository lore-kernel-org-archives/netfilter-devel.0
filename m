I see. You are avoiding the congestion in the socket queue by putting
the pressure in your sync_buff queue  (I don't find any limit in
the code for the amount of memory that it may consume btw).

Please, correct me if I'm wrong, but from this I can se you're
assuming that there's always room in the syn_buff queue to store
messages. This is valid if the high peak of traffic lasts for short
time. However, if it lasts long, the worker thread may not be able to
consume all the messages in time under high stress situation that
lasts long and the sync_buffer may keep growing more and more.

Moreover, the backup may receive sync messages talking about old
states that are not useful anymore to recover the load-balancing in
case of failover.

One more concern, please see below.

This rate-limits the amount of times the worker is woken up.

Still, this seems to me like an ad-hoc congestion solution. There's no
justification why those numbers has been chosed, eg. why do we assume
that we're congested if we've reached 200 packets in one single loop?

To me, congestion control is a complicated thing (there is plenty of
literature for TCP avoid it). I'm not sure how many patches will
follow after this one to try to improve your congestion control
solution.

So, my question is, are you sure you want to enter this domain?

IMO, better to stick to some simple solution, ie. just drop messages
if the worker thread receives a high peak of work, than trying to
define some sort of rate-limit solution based on assumptions that are
not generic enough for every setup.
