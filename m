If it hasn't even started, the earlier for_each_net() has seen all
net namespaces and we managed to clear helper extensions of all conntracks.

Same in case it has finished already: netns cleanup work queue has
free'd all the affected conntracks we might have missed.

We only are in trouble if netns work queue is running concurrently:
netns cleanup first removes net namespaces from the global list,
so nf_ct_iterate_destroy might have missed these.
