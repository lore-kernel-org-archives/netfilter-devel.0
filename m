Good point.  No, I don't.  Any suggestions?
I can try to just re-target -nf tree (sans patch #2).  Pablo?

ipv4 side seems broken as well (ip_defrag frees skb on errors other than
-EINPROGRESS, so it looks like we will double-free in
do_execute_actions)

You're right, we can't signal "skb unchanged".  I guess one could
just test wheter skb is a fragment and -EINVAL if it is, not sure
if its worth doing given that such test would be removed again
by the very next patch?
