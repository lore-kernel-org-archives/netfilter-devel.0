One scenario in which two sysadmins are checking the logs to debug
some issues seems reasonable to me.

Anyway, my main points after testing several your buffer-ring things
are at the bottom of this email.

IMO modularity is a good thing, independent user-space components
allow you to just upgrade the thing that you require.

I think that recompiling your kernel or even wait until your distro
ships the new kernel with new extensions will take longer than packaging
some small user-space software and deploying it. Not talking about
packaging a new iptables package containing support for some new
feature.

This rlogd proof-of-concept thing (and user-space stuff in general)
will:

1) not need any kernel update.
2) be very easy to make a package and to deploy.
3) require no Linux kernel update since NFLOG has been there since
   long time.

Looking at the code, those are included if bridging is enabled.
Otherwise, I'll be happy to take a patch for this.

Reliability is also important, running things in user-space means that
bugs will no crash your system. Instead, they may crash your logging
daemon.

What I find hard to justify is that this feature can be implemented in
user-space with the existing netfilter logging interface.
