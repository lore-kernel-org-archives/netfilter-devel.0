This fixes the use of fwmarks to denote IPv4 virtual services
which was unfortunately broken as a result of the integration
of IPv6 support into IPVS, which was included in 2.6.28.

The problem arises because fwmarks are stored in the 4th octet
of a union nf_inet_addr .all, however in the case of IPv4 only
the first octet, corresponding to .ip, is assigned and compared.

In other words, using .all =3D { 0, 0, 0, htonl(svc->fwmark) always
results in a value of 0 (32bits) being stored for IPv4. This means
that one fwmark can be used, as it ends up being mapped to 0, but thing=
s
break down when multiple fwmarks are used, as they all end up being map=
ped
to 0.

As fwmarks are 32bits a reasonable fix seems to be to just store the fw=
mark
in .ip, and comparing and storing .ip when fwmarks are used.

This patch makes the assumption that in calls to ip_vs_ct_in_get()
and ip_vs_sched_persist() if the proto parameter is IPPROTO_IP then
we are dealing with an fwmark. I believe this is valid as ip_vs_in()
does fairly strict filtering on the protocol and IPPROTO_IP should
not be used in these calls unless explicitly passed when making
these calls for fwmarks in ip_vs_sched_persist().

This problem should probably be fixed in stable too.
Either using this patch, or a simpler though arguably less correct one =
that
uses:

	.all =3D { htonl(svc->fwmark), 0, 0, 0 }

That change doesn't require updating ip_vs_ct_in_get() or ip_vs_conn_ne=
w(),
nor any assumptions about the value of proto. Fabien Duch=EAne has test=
ed
this simpler change and found it to work.
