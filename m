I argue that the above is the user's responsibility.  That said, I don'=
t
see why the user would pass a SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU object to call_rcu().
So I would want to see an example of this before inflicting a pair
of rcu_barrier() calls on kmem_cache_destroy().

This last is I believe kmem_cache's responsibility.
