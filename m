As you can see, the old ->parse() that goes back to libxtables.so.0
still remains. It's just that... only 5 out of 99 plugins still come
with an old parse function.

	[m_xt] -> [libxtables] <- (plugins: libxt_*.so)

old parse has not entered any deprecation stage yet, since there are still
plugins out there (both the 5 and external ones) that make use of it.
Right now, both parse and x6_parse are valid.

Yes, all those with an x6_ prefix are new.
Mh, I already dream of plans reducing m_xt to something that
does not require libxtables.so anymore.
