We have found the problem why the IP addresses were not pingable anymore with Ubuntu 8.04.  It seems that with that release the rp_filter is default on.  If we put this off the modems are pingable again.  In the mean time I don't have my setup fully operational anymore. I've got 1 modem connected for the others I'm sending wget's which timeout since no modem is connected.  I nolonger see any tracing with dmesg, I will need to try again with the full setup to be sure but that will take some time.

When changing the configuration like you suggested, you get something like this for every modem:
vconfig add eth1 129
ifconfig eth1.129 192.168.1.31
route del -net 192.168.1.0/24
route add -host 10.9.9.30 eth1.129
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -o eth1.129 -j DNAT --to 192.168.1.1
ip ro add table 129 default dev eth1.129
ip rule add from 192.168.1.31 table 129
ip ro fl ca

Then it works also, and rp_filter can be on. This also still needs to be tested with the full setup.

I think the problem is solved. Thanks for that in guiding me.
If I should still encounter any problems I will let you know.

** Still wondering why there wasn't any problem with the old kernel ... maybe I just was lucky ...
