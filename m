Indeed.

struct nft_rbtree_elem {
        struct rb_node          node;
        u16                     flags;
        struct nft_data         key;
        struct nft_data         data[];
};

Actually, I could add to nft_data a pointer in the union area, but I'm
not very confortable with adding it for this specific case. At this
moment we're releasing this from rcu_callback which is "hiding" the
deletion time from the netlink interface.

But I'll keep this back in my head if we later on have some pointer
candidate to be reused in a nice way.

I'll send a patch to make the rb_first()/rb_next() conversion though.

Thanks for your comments!
