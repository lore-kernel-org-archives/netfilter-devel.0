Maybe. I think it's worth fixing anyway.

Nope. Look at the logic in nf_conntrack_set_hashsize where you iterate
over init_net.ct.hash but don't touch other namespaces. So then you go
setting nf_conntrack_htable_size and will deference that in accessing
other per-namespace hashtables using the wrong size information.

I'm not sure, I didn't poke at that much yet. But hashtables certainly
need fixing unless you can point out where I'm wrong.

How am I as a sysadmin supposed to figure out which net namespaces exist
on my system, and as a developer, supposed to debug these situations?

Jon.
