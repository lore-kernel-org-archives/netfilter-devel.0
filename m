OK, I'll check this again but I seem to recall this was fine (the
nfqueue module exit path sets the handler to NULL before doing anything
else).

The normal netns exit path should be fine too as exit and free happens
in two distinct loops, i.e. while (without your change) we can have
calls to nf_queue_hook_drop after the nfqueue netns exit function was
called, these calls will always happen before the pernets data is
freed.
