They are per-netns.

It's not "complete", because right now there is no point in doing more.
nf_conntrack_max was rejected given the absense of per-netns kernel
memory consumption limiting.

Only hashtable size which is module parameter and
there is no generic way to limit kernel memory (like beancounters).

There is no need for it to be shared, unless you measured something.

This is known, yes, thinking on it, as naive way was agreed to suck.
