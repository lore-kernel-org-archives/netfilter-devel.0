Hello,

Taking into consideration that there are no current in-tree users of 
this patch and the only known user of this functionality is TOMOYO, 
which is still dealing with some unresolved VFS issues, I suggest not 
merging this patch at the current time.  My recommendation is to 
continue to work on resolving the VFS issues (which it appears you are 
working on) and then submitting all of the required TOMOYO changes at 
once.

As a general rule, removing functionality from the kernel tends to be 
much more difficult then adding it.
