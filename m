I think one of the goals of this patchset is to prepare the removal of
that nf_bridge pointer from sk_buff which sounds as a good idea to me.

Did you consider to implement this scratchpad area using a per-cpu
area? I mean, something similar to what we used to have in
ip_conntrack for events:

http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~baker/devices/lxr/http/source/linux/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_ecache.c?v=2.6.25#L65

Following that approach, I think we could avoid changing the
ip_fragment() interface. My concern is that these changes are too
specific of br_netfilter, which is not a good reference client of it
given all its design problems.

I'm preparing a new net-next batch, I can quickly take these three if
you agree:

1/8 bridge: move mac header copying into br_netfilter
2/8 netfilter: bridge: move nf_bridge_update_protocol to where its used
4/8 netfilter: bridge: refactor conditional in br_nf_dev_queue_xmit

Regarding 3/8, I think we can move that code to br_netfilter.c so we
reduce ifdef pollution a bit and keep as much of this monster code
fenced under that file. Please, see patch attached.

BTW, 6/8 I think needs some ifdef to make sure NF_CONNTRACK is in
placed. 7/8 needs NF_BRDIGE_MAX_MAC_HEADER_LENGTH which seems to have
a small typo in it, well these are dependent of 4/8 anyway.

Let me know, thanks a lot!

Subject: [PATCH] netfilter: brige: move DNAT helper to br_netfilter

Only one caller, there is no need to keep this in a header.
Move it to br_netfilter.c where this belongs to.

Based on patch from Florian Westphal.
