In nftables, user can use concatenations to put two or more selectors together.
For example, we can use "nft add rule x y tcp dport . ip saddr 22 . 1.1.1.1"
to match the tcp dest port and ip source addr at the same time.

In such case, tcp dport will be stored to REG0 and ip saddr will be stored to
REG1, so the layout will be like this(from the lowest address):
  PORT(2 bytes) - XXXX(2 bytes) - IPADDR(4 bytes)

Later we will use the statement "memcmp(&reg, &data, 8)" to do compare,
so the XXXX part must be filled with zero to avoid garbage value.
