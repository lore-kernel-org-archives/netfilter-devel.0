Heh, and then (browsing through your copy_process() patch hunks) the next
forked task becomes the child reaper for the new pidns?  <shrug>  why not
I guess.

Now if that child reaper then gets killed, will the idle task get killed too?
And if not, then idle task can just re-populating the new pidns with new
idle tasks...

If this brought us a step closer to entering an existing pidns that would
be one thing, but is there actually any advantage to being able to
unshare a new pidns?  Oh, I guess there is - PAM can then use it at
login, which might be neat.
