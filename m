Now I remember - the reason why ctnetlink called ip_conntrack_put
in ctnetlink_kill is because it uses ip_conntrack_find_get before,
which increments the reference count. This is wrong because the
conntrack is then destroyed immediately after returning 1 to
ip_ct_selective_cleanup, but still used for comparing the tuple.
You (and ctnetlink) need to call ip_conntrack_put after the
call to ip_ct_selective_cleanup. In fact you shouldn't use
ip_ct_selective_cleanup at all but destroy it yourself. You
already have a reference, so there is no need to iterate through
the entire hash.
