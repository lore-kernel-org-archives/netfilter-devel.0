So in your case "netstat -atn" displays port 80 , not port 9999 for
children, and 9999 for the listener ?=20

Really ?

So lock[80] is taken at insert time (as your patch doesnt change
locking), and lock[9999] taken at delete time ? How comes it doesnt
race ?


Look I am _very_ confused by this stuff.

How can you explain lock is taken on table->bhash[80].lock but your
patch adds a chain to table->bhash[9999] ? This is not what your patch
is trying to do. Or you should lock table->bhash[9999].lock=20


Please check the comment in front of inet_bind_bucket_create() :

/*
 * Allocate and initialize a new local port bind bucket.
 * The bindhash mutex for snum's hash chain must be held here.
 */

Maybe change this comment, because clearly "snum's hash" meaning is ver=
y
different after tproxy inclusion (and your patch) ?

Your patch Changelog is not clear enough, or very misleading ...

commit f517f61e37907ea66e48f224c135a9e1c257bb04
Author: Stephen Buck <stephen.buck@exinda.com>

    Fix locking issue in inet_hashtables when using tproxy
   =20
    When __inet_inherit_port() is called on a tproxy connection the wro=
ng locks
    are held for the inet_bind_bucket it is added to.



Since your patch does nothing about the lock itself, but adds a=20
new struct inet_bind_bucket in case the parent one is not appropriate, =
and
another sibling is not yet present.

I suggest you include in ChangeLog _all_ your email, because I am
pretty sure nobody will understand the intent of your patch in 2011.

I am sure the full explanation is better than a very short log entry.

Thanks
